connection never worked.\n\n    Make sure you have a valid UH Username and password.\n    Check that a valid Network Name (SSID) is being used (see Network Connectivity Matrix above).\n    Check for adequate signal strength for the SSID. If your signal strength is moderate or low, try moving to a different location where the signal strength is good or excellent. If you are on the UH Manoa Campus, please check the UH Manoa wireless map to make sure the UHM wireless network is available in the area where you are trying to connect.\n    In your device's network settings, check to see if your wireless connection is bridged with another connection. Remove the bridge if necessary.\n    If using a computer or laptop, you could try to remove the existing wireless adapter and reinstall them. Also check for updated drivers for your wireless adapter at the manufacturer's website.\n    If you have an external adapter for your computer or laptop, try your wireless adapter in another computer to make sure the adapter is working properly.\n    If you have built-in wireless that came with your laptop, check to see if there is an external switch to enable or disable your wireless connection.\n\nI can connect and get to the wireless authentication page, but I can't get past that page.\n\n    Make sure you have a valid UH Username and Password.\n\nIf you are still experiencing issues with wireless, or are at the UH-Manoa campus, please contact the ITS Help Desk: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk."

Rather than manually entering many individual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email address: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those in the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of reaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially useful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent.\nIndividual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are specific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly the specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the same group of people, unless they manually enter the group members’ email addresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate nature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain, and manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers a mailing list service called Listserv.\nUH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a message to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message to the Listserv list’s email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the message, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that list. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given permission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to subscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does not matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and maintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with access to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users if desired.\n\nThe owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently according to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using keywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The following are some common uses of Listserv lists:\n·         One-way announcement – The list owners/administrators are the only people who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list is primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of information that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers.\n\n·         Two-way discussion – The list administrators and subscribers are all permitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used for discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information centered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss ideas and information related to that organization.\n\n·         Moderated – The list administrator(s) will review all incoming messages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the message to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used to control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or other unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers.\nTo use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of the outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone who is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that you normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named \"group-l\" and add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would be group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a message to twenty addresses:\n\nTO: user1@hawaii.edu, user2@hawaii.edu … user20@hawaii.edu\nCC:\nYou would send the message to the list address:\n            TO: group-l@lists.hawaii.edu\nEveryone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the message. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to email is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone individually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using a Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of individuals from being flagged as \"spamming\" behavior by Google or other email service providers.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing list, please refer to the online documentation available at: https://listserv.hawaii.edu/\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow do I request a new LISTSERV list?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    Login to the LISTSERV request page with your UH username and password.\n    Follow the instructions on the page. You will need to supply a name for the new list (must include a hyphen), provide a description, and select one of the configuration options.\n    At the bottom of the page, acknowledge the terms of use (UH Executive Policy E2.210, Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statutes, List Owner's Responsibilities) by checking off the boxes and click on \"Request List\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tList Owner's Responsibilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tA list owner is entrusted with its members’ personal information (email address and name), and this carries certain responsibilities with regards to ensuring privacy and security. You must determine what level of security is most appropriate for your list. For example, a closed family list where all members know each other personally may be set to Review=Private (any list member may get the list of all subscribed addresses), but any list with subscriptions open to the public should be set to Review=Owners. A hobby discussion list may operate with relaxed security and deal with transgressions as they occur, but a commercial newsletter must have very tight security as any breach will reflect poorly on the department/organization’s reputation. On an open discussion list, subscribers are aware that the discussion may sometimes stray off the topic, whereas on a moderated list they expect that you will exercise more control over what gets posted. On a one-way list, subscribers will hold you responsible for every posting.\nAs the owner of the list, it is your responsibility to:\n \n\n    Understand your list’s configuration.\n\n\n    Let subscribers know what they can expect from the list when they sign up.\n\n\n    Help subscribers subscribe and sign off.\n\n\n    Assist subscribers when they have difficulties with the list.\n\n\n    Ensure that the list abides by the site’s appropriate use policy and applicable laws (for example, disallow the propagation of copyrighted materials not belonging to the sender) included in the UH Executive Policy E2.210 and Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statues.\n\n\n    Prevent abuse of the list by third parties. For example, always require subscription confirmations on open lists, prevent outside access to subscriber email addresses (Review=Owner), and require confirmation of all postings to one-way lists (Send=…,Confirm).\n\n\n    Receive and review all mail sent to the listname-request address. This address is publicized as the way to get in touch with the list owner when a subscriber or potential subscriber requires assistance. http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1091\n\n \n\n\n \nUsing LISTSERV\n \n\n\n\n\tHow Can I Access LISTSERV?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYou can perform actions in LISTSERV by sending a command through email or using the Web interface. Some commands are only available to LISTSERV administrators and list owners while other commands are available to subscribers and non-subscribers as well.\nUsing Email to Communicate with LISTSERV\n\nThere are two main email addresses that are used to work with LISTSERV lists. One is to communicate with the LISTSERV program — a “command address.” The other is used to post mail to the list — the “list address.” If you want to change a list configuration or subscription setting, you would email listserv@lists.hawaii.edu. If you want to post a message to the list, you would email the list address (ex: examplelist-l@lists.hawaii.edu).  \nUsing the Web Interface to Communicate with LISTSERV\n\nSending email messages containing commands to LISTSERV and posting messages to the list is sometimes confusing for people who are new to mailing lists. To simplify this process, the Web interface provides a centralized location for interaction with LISTSERV. You can use the Web interface to issue commands directly to LISTSERV and post simple messages to the list.\nTo access the Web interface, visit https://listserv.hawaii.edu/ and sign in using your email address (example@hawaii.edu). First time users must submit an account request by registering a password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhat is the \"OK\" Confirmation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTo increase security, there are a number of actions for which LISTSERV requires confirmation before proceeding. In some cases, LISTSERV will accept a password-based validation. In other cases, email confirmation is required. When the latter happens, LISTSERV sends an email message with a subject line such as: \nSubject:           Command confirmation request (787EF897) \nThe string of letters and numbers in parentheses (“787EF897” in the example) is called a “cookie” (sometimes referred to as a “confirmation code”) and is different for each request. \nOnce an “OK” confirmation request is sent out, you must confirm it within 48 hours in order for the corresponding command to be executed.\nThere are three methods of confirming a command:\n\n    To confirm using the Web interface, click on the link provided in the email message sent to you.\n    To confirm via email, reply to the email message keeping the Subject      line and cookie intact. In the body of your reply, type “OK”      (without the quotes).\n    Alternatively, you can send a new email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank      subject line and the body of the message containing the text “OK xxxxxxxx” where “xxxxxxxx” is the cookie      from the original confirmation request email.\n\nThe cookie is the most important part of the “OK” confirmation. LISTSERV randomly generates a new cookie for each action that requires validation. All privileges within LISTSERV are tied to an email address. Only someone with access to your email address can make changes to your LISTSERV account.\nCaution: Never “OK” a cookie blindly. Make sure you are confirming a command that you initiated or a message that you want distributed to the list. Several cases of list “hijacking” or spam sent to well-secured lists have been tracked back to a list owner or moderator absent-mindedly clicking an OK link that they should not have clicked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAccessing LISTSERV via the Web\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThis article provides a quick tour of the list management areas of the web interface. For more information about each page, refer to the online documentation by clicking on the question mark in the top-right corner. Some common tasks have been included in the next section.\nGetting Started\nTo get started, navigate to https://listserv.hawaii.edu and click on Log In.\n\nIf you have already registered with UH LISTSERV, enter the email address and password you supplied when creating your account and click Log In. If this is your first time accessing UH LISTSERV or if you are already registered but have forgotten your password, click on the respective Register Password or Forgot Password link and fill in the requested information. After submitting the form, a confirmation email will be sent to the address provided. Click on the link in the email to verify your request. Then, use the instructions above to log into your account using your new credentials.  \nNote: Your password for the LISTSERV must be a minimum of 5 non-space characters. This password is independent of your UH username password. As with all passwords, you should create one that is unique, and you should not distribute it to others.\nNavigating the Web Interface\nThe Web Interface is divided into the following parts:\n\n    Top Banner – This banner is diplayed at the top of every page. Clicking on the UH LISTSERV logo on the far left will take you to the start page designated within your preferences. The button to the right of the UH LISTSERV logo can be used to toggle the navigation pane. On the right side, clicking on your email address will show your account profile. Finally, the ? button in the top-right corner will bring up documentation on the current page. \n    Navigation Pane – On the left side of the main form is the navigation pane. The navigation pane stays the same from page to page and contains links to various areas of the web interface that you have access to. These areas can be grouped into two main categories: List Management, and Subscriber Options.\n    Resources – This section contains links to general information, user documentation, frequently asked questions, and the request form for new lists.\n\n\nIn LISTSERV 17.0, you can choose between two modes for the web interface.\n\n    Basic – Only the most common options are shown, but no tutorial text is displayed. This is the best mode for those users who are familiar with LISTSERV, but who are not experts and do not need to use the more advanced features. This is the default setting.\n    Expert – Similarly to Basic mode, each web page is displayed with no tutorial text. However, certain pages may contain advanced options that are not available in Basic mode. Expert mode is available for users who are very familiar with LISTSERV or need access to any advanced settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the mode, click on Preferences in the Navigation Pane on the left. Make sure that the General tab is selected. Then, use the drop-down menu next to Mode to make the desired selection. Finally, click on the Update button to save your choice.\n \n\nList Owner Management\n\nBelow is a listing of list management pages accessible via the navigation pane on the left. If you are the owner of only one list, the management page for that list will be displayed. If you own more than one list, you will need to use the drop-down menu to select the list you want to modify.\n\n    \n        \n            \n            List Dashboard \n            \n            \n            This section displays a user interface that organizes and presents information about your list(s). Additionally, you can quickly access some list configuration settings by clicking on the corresponding fields within the table.\n             \n            \n        \n        \n            List Moderation\n            \n            If your list has moderation enabled, this section will display incoming messages that require approval before being forwarded out to list subscribers.\n             \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            List Configuration \n            \n            \n            This section displays various settings for lists you own. The following are some of the items that can be configured: administrators, subscription settings, security settings, archives and logs, allowed attachments, error handling, and distribution settings.\n             \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            List Customization\n            \n            \n            This section displays color and appearance customization options.\n             \n             \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            List Reports \n            \n            \n            This section allows list owners to generate reports on their lists or search for lists meeting specific criteria.\n             \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Subscriber Reports\n            \n            \n            This section displays the current subscribers of a list and their subscription settings.\n             \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            List Activity Reports\n            \n            \n            \n            This section displays reports on specific events that occured within a given time frame.\n             \n            \n        \n        \n            Subscriber Management\n            \n            This section allows you to add, remove, and modify subscription settings for individual subscribers.\n             \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Web Templates\n            \n            \n            This section allows you to customize the LISTSERV web interface.\n             \n            \n        \n        \n            Mail Templates             \n            \n            This section allows you to customize automated emails sent by a list.\n             \n            \n        \n        \n            Newsletter Templates\n            \n            This section allows you to create and modify HTML templates for newsletters sent via a list.\n             \n            \n        \n        \n            LISTSERV Command\n            This section allows you to issue text based commands to the LISTSERV processor without using your email address.\n        \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\tCommon List Configuration Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSimple Mail Redirect (Mail Alias)\nDescription: This configuration simulates a mail alias.

If you need to search for specific subscribers, the search bar underneath the Subscribers column header can be used to filter email addresses.\n    Once all subscribers that need to be deleted have been selected, click on Delete Subscribers at the bottom of the page.\n    A message will appear asking if you are sure you would like to delete the selected subscribers. Press Delete to confirm.\n    Verify that the subscribers no longer exist by searching for them.\n\nTo add or delete multiple subscriptions (for list owners):\n\n    Create a text (.txt) file with the subscribers you want to add to or remove from the list. The file should contain one email address, optionally followed by the subscriber's first and last name separated by a space, per line. (Ex: jdoe@hawaii.edu John Doe)\n    Under the List Management options in the navigation pane on the left, click on Subscriber Reports.\n    Select the list you would like to manage from the drop-down menu.\n    Click on Bulk Operations.\n    Select the option corresponding to the action you would like to take, click Choose File, and upload the text file you created in Step 1 using the resulting prompt.\n    Click on the Import button to add or remove the subscriber(s). Some text in blue should appear detailing the changes made to your list.\n\nTo change your list’s configuration: \n\n    Under the List Management options in the navigation pane on the left, click on List Configuration.\n    Select the list you would like to manage from the drop-down menu.\n    Make the desired changes to your list settings and click on Update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCommon Tasks Using Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIf you are used to using email to make changes to your list, you can continue to do so. To issue commands to LISTSERV, compose an email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank subject line. The body of the message should contain only commands to LISTSERV with one command per line. Lines containing non-commands will result in an error message being returned. Be careful not to include your signature in your email if you have one set up, as LISTSERV will attempt to interpret the signature text as commands and return “Invalid command” errors. Below are some common commands you can issue via email:\n\n    To obtain a listing of all the public mailing lists on the UH server:\n    \n    list\n\n\n    To add a subscriber to a list (for list owners):\n    \n    add history150-l jdoe@hawaii.edu Jane Doe\n    \n    To delete a subscriber from a list (for list owners):\n    \n    delete history150-l jdoe@hawaii.edu\n    \n    \n    Getting Help:\n    \n    help"

    "title": "What is a Mailing List?",
    "content": "A mailing list is a tool that provides users with the means to disseminate information via email to groups of people. Rather than manually entering many individual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email address: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those in the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of reaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially useful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent.\nIndividual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are specific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly the specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the same group of people, unless they manually enter the group members’ email addresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate nature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain, and manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers a mailing list service called Listserv.\nUH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a message to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message to the Listserv list’s email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the message, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that list. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given permission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to subscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does not matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and maintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with access to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users if desired.\n\nThe owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently according to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using keywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The following are some common uses of Listserv lists:\n·         One-way announcement – The list owners/administrators are the only people who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list is primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of information that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers.\n\n·         Two-way discussion – The list administrators and subscribers are all permitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used for discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information centered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss ideas and information related to that organization.\n\n·         Moderated – The list administrator(s) will review all incoming messages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the message to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used to control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or other unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers.\nTo use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of the outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone who is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that you normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named \"group-l\" and add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would be group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a message to twenty addresses:\n\nTO: user1@hawaii.edu, user2@hawaii.edu … user20@hawaii.edu\nCC:\nYou would send the message to the list address:\n            TO: group-l@lists.hawaii.edu\nEveryone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the message. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to email is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone individually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using a Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of individuals from being flagged as \"spamming\" behavior by Google or other email service providers.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing list, please refer to the online documentation available at: https://listserv.hawaii.edu/"

    "title": "How Can I Access LISTSERV?",
    "content": "You can perform actions in LISTSERV by sending a command through email or using the Web interface. Some commands are only available to LISTSERV administrators and list owners while other commands are available to subscribers and non-subscribers as well.\nUsing Email to Communicate with LISTSERV\n\nThere are two main email addresses that are used to work with LISTSERV lists. One is to communicate with the LISTSERV program — a “command address.” The other is used to post mail to the list — the “list address.” If you want to change a list configuration or subscription setting, you would email listserv@lists.hawaii.edu. If you want to post a message to the list, you would email the list address (ex: examplelist-l@lists.hawaii.edu).  \nUsing the Web Interface to Communicate with LISTSERV\n\nSending email messages containing commands to LISTSERV and posting messages to the list is sometimes confusing for people who are new to mailing lists. To simplify this process, the Web interface provides a centralized location for interaction with LISTSERV. You can use the Web interface to issue commands directly to LISTSERV and post simple messages to the list.\nTo access the Web interface, visit https://listserv.hawaii.edu/ and sign in using your email address (example@hawaii.edu). First time users must submit an account request by registering a password."

    "title": "What is the \"OK\" Confirmation?",
    "content": "To increase security, there are a number of actions for which LISTSERV requires confirmation before proceeding. In some cases, LISTSERV will accept a password-based validation. In other cases, email confirmation is required. When the latter happens, LISTSERV sends an email message with a subject line such as: \nSubject:           Command confirmation request (787EF897) \nThe string of letters and numbers in parentheses (“787EF897” in the example) is called a “cookie” (sometimes referred to as a “confirmation code”) and is different for each request. \nOnce an “OK” confirmation request is sent out, you must confirm it within 48 hours in order for the corresponding command to be executed.\nThere are three methods of confirming a command:\n\n    To confirm using the Web interface, click on the link provided in the email message sent to you.\n    To confirm via email, reply to the email message keeping the Subject      line and cookie intact. In the body of your reply, type “OK”      (without the quotes).\n    Alternatively, you can send a new email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank      subject line and the body of the message containing the text “OK xxxxxxxx” where “xxxxxxxx” is the cookie      from the original confirmation request email.\n\nThe cookie is the most important part of the “OK” confirmation. LISTSERV randomly generates a new cookie for each action that requires validation. All privileges within LISTSERV are tied to an email address. Only someone with access to your email address can make changes to your LISTSERV account.\nCaution: Never “OK” a cookie blindly. Make sure you are confirming a command that you initiated or a message that you want distributed to the list. Several cases of list “hijacking” or spam sent to well-secured lists have been tracked back to a list owner or moderator absent-mindedly clicking an OK link that they should not have clicked."

    "content": "This article provides a quick tour of the list management areas of the web interface. For more information about each page, refer to the online documentation by clicking on the question mark in the top-right corner. Some common tasks have been included in the next section.\nGetting Started\nTo get started, navigate to https://listserv.hawaii.edu and click on Log In.\n\nIf you have already registered with UH LISTSERV, enter the email address and password you supplied when creating your account and click Log In. If this is your first time accessing UH LISTSERV or if you are already registered but have forgotten your password, click on the respective Register Password or Forgot Password link and fill in the requested information. After submitting the form, a confirmation email will be sent to the address provided. Click on the link in the email to verify your request. Then, use the instructions above to log into your account using your new credentials.  \nNote: Your password for the LISTSERV must be a minimum of 5 non-space characters. This password is independent of your UH username password. As with all passwords, you should create one that is unique, and you should not distribute it to others.\nNavigating the Web Interface\nThe Web Interface is divided into the following parts:\n\n    Top Banner – This banner is diplayed at the top of every page. Clicking on the UH LISTSERV logo on the far left will take you to the start page designated within your preferences. The button to the right of the UH LISTSERV logo can be used to toggle the navigation pane. On the right side, clicking on your email address will show your account profile. Finally, the ? button in the top-right corner will bring up documentation on the current page. \n    Navigation Pane – On the left side of the main form is the navigation pane. The navigation pane stays the same from page to page and contains links to various areas of the web interface that you have access to. These areas can be grouped into two main categories: List Management, and Subscriber Options.\n    Resources – This section contains links to general information, user documentation, frequently asked questions, and the request form for new lists.\n\n\nIn LISTSERV 17.0, you can choose between two modes for the web interface.\n\n    Basic – Only the most common options are shown, but no tutorial text is displayed. This is the best mode for those users who are familiar with LISTSERV, but who are not experts and do not need to use the more advanced features. This is the default setting.\n    Expert – Similarly to Basic mode, each web page is displayed with no tutorial text. However, certain pages may contain advanced options that are not available in Basic mode. Expert mode is available for users who are very familiar with LISTSERV or need access to any advanced settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the mode, click on Preferences in the Navigation Pane on the left. Make sure that the General tab is selected. Then, use the drop-down menu next to Mode to make the desired selection. Finally, click on the Update button to save your choice.\n \n\nList Owner Management\n\nBelow is a listing of list management pages accessible via the navigation pane on the left. If you are the owner of only one list, the management page for that list will be displayed.

    "content": "A list owner is entrusted with its members’ personal information (email address and name), and this carries certain responsibilities with regards to ensuring privacy and security. You must determine what level of security is most appropriate for your list. For example, a closed family list where all members know each other personally may be set to Review=Private (any list member may get the list of all subscribed addresses), but any list with subscriptions open to the public should be set to Review=Owners. A hobby discussion list may operate with relaxed security and deal with transgressions as they occur, but a commercial newsletter must have very tight security as any breach will reflect poorly on the department/organization’s reputation. On an open discussion list, subscribers are aware that the discussion may sometimes stray off the topic, whereas on a moderated list they expect that you will exercise more control over what gets posted. On a one-way list, subscribers will hold you responsible for every posting.\nAs the owner of the list, it is your responsibility to:\n \n\n    Understand your list’s configuration.\n\n\n    Let subscribers know what they can expect from the list when they sign up.\n\n\n    Help subscribers subscribe and sign off.\n\n\n    Assist subscribers when they have difficulties with the list.\n\n\n    Ensure that the list abides by the site’s appropriate use policy and applicable laws (for example, disallow the propagation of copyrighted materials not belonging to the sender) included in the UH Executive Policy E2.210 and Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statues.\n\n\n    Prevent abuse of the list by third parties. For example, always require subscription confirmations on open lists, prevent outside access to subscriber email addresses (Review=Owner), and require confirmation of all postings to one-way lists (Send=…,Confirm).\n\n\n    Receive and review all mail sent to the listname-request address.

Rather than manually entering many individual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email address: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those in the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of reaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially useful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent.\nIndividual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are specific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly the specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the same group of people, unless they manually enter the group members’ email addresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate nature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain, and manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers a mailing list service called Listserv.\nUH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a message to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message to the Listserv list’s email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the message, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that list. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given permission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to subscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does not matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and maintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with access to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users if desired.\n\nThe owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently according to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using keywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The following are some common uses of Listserv lists:\n·         One-way announcement – The list owners/administrators are the only people who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list is primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of information that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers.\n\n·         Two-way discussion – The list administrators and subscribers are all permitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used for discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information centered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss ideas and information related to that organization.\n\n·         Moderated – The list administrator(s) will review all incoming messages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the message to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used to control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or other unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers.\nTo use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of the outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone who is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that you normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named \"group-l\" and add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would be group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a message to twenty addresses:\n\nTO: user1@hawaii.edu, user2@hawaii.edu … user20@hawaii.edu\nCC:\nYou would send the message to the list address:\n            TO: group-l@lists.hawaii.edu\nEveryone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the message. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to email is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone individually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using a Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of individuals from being flagged as \"spamming\" behavior by Google or other email service providers.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing list, please refer to the online documentation available at: https://listserv.hawaii.edu/\n\n\n \nUsing LISTSERV\n\n\n\n\tHow Can I Access LISTSERV?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYou can perform actions in LISTSERV by sending a command through email or using the Web interface. Some commands are only available to LISTSERV administrators and list owners while other commands are available to subscribers and non-subscribers as well.\nUsing Email to Communicate with LISTSERV\n\nThere are two main email addresses that are used to work with LISTSERV lists. One is to communicate with the LISTSERV program — a “command address.” The other is used to post mail to the list — the “list address.” If you want to change a list configuration or subscription setting, you would email listserv@lists.hawaii.edu. If you want to post a message to the list, you would email the list address (ex: examplelist-l@lists.hawaii.edu).  \nUsing the Web Interface to Communicate with LISTSERV\n\nSending email messages containing commands to LISTSERV and posting messages to the list is sometimes confusing for people who are new to mailing lists. To simplify this process, the Web interface provides a centralized location for interaction with LISTSERV. You can use the Web interface to issue commands directly to LISTSERV and post simple messages to the list.\nTo access the Web interface, visit https://listserv.hawaii.edu/ and sign in using your email address (example@hawaii.edu). First time users must submit an account request by registering a password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhat is the \"OK\" Confirmation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTo increase security, there are a number of actions for which LISTSERV requires confirmation before proceeding. In some cases, LISTSERV will accept a password-based validation. In other cases, email confirmation is required. When the latter happens, LISTSERV sends an email message with a subject line such as: \nSubject:           Command confirmation request (787EF897) \nThe string of letters and numbers in parentheses (“787EF897” in the example) is called a “cookie” (sometimes referred to as a “confirmation code”) and is different for each request. \nOnce an “OK” confirmation request is sent out, you must confirm it within 48 hours in order for the corresponding command to be executed.\nThere are three methods of confirming a command:\n\n    To confirm using the Web interface, click on the link provided in the email message sent to you.\n    To confirm via email, reply to the email message keeping the Subject      line and cookie intact. In the body of your reply, type “OK”      (without the quotes).\n    Alternatively, you can send a new email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank      subject line and the body of the message containing the text “OK xxxxxxxx” where “xxxxxxxx” is the cookie      from the original confirmation request email.\n\nThe cookie is the most important part of the “OK” confirmation. LISTSERV randomly generates a new cookie for each action that requires validation. All privileges within LISTSERV are tied to an email address. Only someone with access to your email address can make changes to your LISTSERV account.\nCaution: Never “OK” a cookie blindly. Make sure you are confirming a command that you initiated or a message that you want distributed to the list. Several cases of list “hijacking” or spam sent to well-secured lists have been tracked back to a list owner or moderator absent-mindedly clicking an OK link that they should not have clicked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAccessing LISTSERV via the Web (Subscribers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThis section provides a quick tour of the subscriber view of the Web interface. For more information about each page, you may refer to the online help by clicking on the ? in the top-right corner. Some common tasks have been detailed in the following sections.\nGetting Started \nTo get started, direct your browser to https://listserv.hawaii.edu and click Log In in the top-right corner. If you have already registered with UH LISTSERV, enter your email address and LISTSERV account password and click Log In.\n \n\n \nIf you do not yet have a LISTSERV account or do not remember your password, click on Register Password or Forgot Password respectively and fill in the requested information. A command confirmation request will be sent to your email address for verification. Click on the link in the email to confirm your request. Your request will be processed once this confirmation is received.\n \nNote: Your password for the LISTSERV must be a minimum of 5 non-space characters. This password is independent of your UH username password. Like any password, you should take care in creating one that is unique and should not distribute it to others.\n\n\n\nOnce the above has been completed, return to the log in page and sign in using your email address and newly registered LISTSERV password. The University of Hawai‘i LISTSERV home page will be displayed with a variety of menu options available from the navigation pane on the left. The selections available to you will depend on your role – Subscriber or List Owner.\n\nNavigating the Web Interface \n\nThe navigation pane is located on the left side of the LISTSERV Web interace (you may need to click on the > in the top-left corner to make it visible). This menu generally stays the same from page to page and contains links to various areas of the Web interface you have access to.\n\n\n\nIn LISTSERV 17.0, you can choose between two modes for the web interface. \n\n    Basic - Only the most common options are shown. This is best for users who are not experts and do not need to use more advanced features. This is the default setting.\n    Expert - Certain pages may contain advanced options that are not available in Basic mode. Expert mode is recommended for users who are very familiar with LISTSERV and/or need access to advanced settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change interface modes, click on your email address in the top-right corner. Then, click on Edit Profile and, using the Mode drop-down menu, select the mode type you would like to use.

If you do not take precautions against this type of attack, a malicious user can insert SQL statements that can return more data than intended or cause damage to your database. This could lead to an exploit that compromises the web server.\nMinimizing Risk\nWe suggest the following techniques to minimize the risk1:\n\n    Validate user input. If you are expecting a number, check that you receive a number.\n    Use functions like htmlspecialchars, stripslashes, and mysql_real_escape_string to clean malicious input.\n\nExternal Links:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection\nhttp://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php\nhttps://secure.php.net/manual/en/security.database.sql-injection.php\nAt a minimum, data that will be incorporated into SQL queries for a MySQL database should be sanitized using the mysqli_real_escape_string function.  Ideally, prepared statements with placeholders should be used when querying a database.\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has a cheat sheet on methods to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities:\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet\n \nPHP Sample code\n\n    Remove non-alphanumeric characters from input\n    \n    //get raw input\n    $input = $_REQUEST['input'];      //characters not allowed in input\n    $pattern = \"/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/\"; // regex pattern means: all characters NOT in a-z, A-Z and 0-9\n    \n    //remove all characters that are not allowed\n    $input = preg_replace($pattern, \"\", $input);\n    \n    //build SQL statement with validated input\n    //$dbconnect is the database connection\n    $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = \"' . mysqli_real_escape_string($dbconnect, $input) . '\";';\n\n\n    Only run query if input is numeric\n    \n    if (is_numeric($_REQUEST['input'])) {\n        //build SQL statement with validated input\n        $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = ' . $input . ';';\n    }\n\n\n    Clean malicious input with htmlspecialchars, stripslashes, and mysql_real_escape_string\n    \n    // you can nest the functions\n    $username = htmlspecialchars(stripslashes($_REQUEST['username']));\n    \n    // or use them individually\n    // $dbconnect is the database connection\n    $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE username = \"' . mysqli_real_escape_string($dbconnect, $username) . '\";';\n\n\n1 Because the ITS hosted web sites uses PHP, this article references PHP functions, has PHP external links and the examples are in PHP. Regardless of the programming language you use, there should be similar functionality available."

    "content": "Laulima: Upload & Download Multiple Files via WebDAV\nWebDAV stands for \"Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning”. WebDAV can be used to manage files (eg. upload/download) on remote web servers (eg. Laulima). The interface is similar to having an external hard drive/flash drive attached to your computer, allowing you to drag copies of multiple files to the server.\nFor more information on WebDAV see: http://webdav.org\nYou can use WebDAV to upload multiple files to the Resources Tool in Laulima. You can also access information on how to do this via the “Transfer Files” tab in the Resources Tool within Laulima or at the TALENT page (http://www.hawaii.edu/talent).\nWebDAV works differently depending on which computer operating system and version you use (eg. Windows 7, Windows 10, Mac OSX). Listed below is basic information on setting up some common operating systems to connect with Laulima via WebDAV.\nMicrosoft Windows 8/10\nMac OSX\nLinux\nOther (Cyberduck)\n\nMicrosoft Windows 10\n\n    From the Desktop, click File Explorer and make sure 'This PC' is selected in the left-hand pane.\n    At the top of the File Explorer window, click Computer > Map Network Drive > Map network drive.\n    Select a vacant drive letter (e.g., Z) from the Drive drop down menu.\n    In the Folder field, type (or copy and paste) the URL for this site (shown near the top of the Transfer Files area). Click Finish.\n    When prompted, enter your username and password and click OK.\n    You can now drag files and folders to and from your computer and the site Resources folder.\n\nAlternate method of setting up WebDAV on Windows:\nIf  the process above yields connections errors, you may  be able to  utilize the WebDAV functionality to access your files using a  free  third-party client called Cyberduck.\n\nMicrosoft Windows 11\n\n    From the Desktop, click File Explorer and make sure 'This PC' is selected in the left-hand pane.\n    At the top of the File Explorer window, click the three dots ...> Map Network Drive.\n    Select a vacant drive letter (e.g., Z) from the Drive drop down menu.\n    In the Folder field, type (or copy and paste) the URL for this  site (shown near the top of the Transfer Files area).

If you have problems with this approach, consider using Cyberduck.\n\n    From the menu bar at the top of the screen in Finder, select Go > Connect to Server...\n    In the Server Address dialog box, type (or copy and paste) the path (shown near the top of the Transfer Files area).\n    Press the + button to save this path for future use.\n    Click Connect.\n    Type in your username and password and click Connect.\n\nThe window will then show the contents of your Resources folder. You can then drag files to and from this window to copy files, or move files into different folders in Laulima, etc\nAs noted previously, you can alternatively set up WebDAV with Cyberduck\n.\n\nLinux\nNote: Linux is not an officially supported OS by ITS\nSetting up WebDAV for Linux (Gnome):\n\n    Go to Files > Connect to Server...\n    In Server adress, type (or copy and paste) the URL shown near the top of the Transfer Files area.\n    Click on Connect.\n    Supply your password.\n\nYou will now see a new drive under Files. This represents the resources in your site. It will act like any other folder on your computer. You can now drag and drop files into or out of this window and delete files by dragging them to the Trash.\n \nSetting up WebDAV for older versions of Linux (Gnome):\nGo to Places > Connect to Server...\n\n    In Service, type select WebDav (HTTP/SSL).\n    In Server, type (or copy and paste): laulima.hawaii.edu.\n    In Port, type (or copy and paste): 443\n    In Folder, type (or copy and paste) the last part of the URL shown near the top of the Transfer Files area (the part of the url starting with \"dav\").\n    Check the option Add bookmark\n     In Bookmark name, supply the name of the folder to create under \"Network\" and click Next.\n     Click on Connect.\n     Supply your password.\n\nYou will now see a new drive under Places.

These files are referred to as attachments . Any kind of computer file can be an attachment: a word processing file, a spreadsheet, a database, an audio or video file, etc. However, please be advised that email with certain extensions are deleted due to security risks e.g. viruses or other damaging programs. For more information, please refer to: http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6590\n\nAlthough the recipient may be able to receive an attachment, the file is not usable if the recipient does not also have the appropriate program to read the file. For example, if you send an MS Word file to a person who uses Word Perfect, the recipient may not be able to use the file. Likewise, there are sometimes problems involved in sending files between PCs and Macs.\n\nIn addition, Google imposes a maximum email size limit of 25 MB. (As a caution, large files take up valuable quota disk space and should be off-loaded to your personal computer.) As an alternative, please see the File Drop service at: http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop for transferring large files.\n\nTo send an attachment: compose a message and click Attach a file (next to paper clip) on the tool bar. Use the browser to find the file to attach and click Open to attach the file. (If your files are large you may see a progress bar as your file is uploaded) To attach another file click on Attach another file and follow the same procedures. To remove an attachment , uncheck the box for appropriate file. \nIt is good practice to mention that you are sending an attachment and specify its format. (For example: \"I am attaching a spreadsheet in MS Excel 2003 format.\")\n\nTo receive an attachment: Read the message as you normally would. If there is an attachment, they will be displayed below the message. Depending on the attachment type, you may have several options to choose from.

To do so, click on the gear icon in the upper right and select Settings, then scroll down to Vacation responder. You are prompted for a start and optionally a stop date for the vacation messages, also for a subject and some text to include. When you are done, click Save Changes. For more help, click Learn More under Vacation responder.\nHow to forward a copy of all the messages you receive to another email address\nClick on the gear icon in the upper right and select Settings, then click Forwarding and POP/IMAP.

Everything listed in the \"My Calendars\" section are calendars that you have complete control over.\nIf you click on a calendar's name (furthest column on the left), you will be taken to a Calendar Details window for that calendar.  On this window, you can change the following options.\nCalendar Name\nUse this to change the name that appears for the calendar in your \"My Calendars\" section, and

do not conflict\", which means that any invitation that does not conflict with an event that's already on your calendar will be accepted and added to your calendar.  You can also choose \"Do not show invitations\", which means meetings will only be added to your calendar if you accept them.\nEmbed This Calendar\nYou can copy and paste the code shown into a website if you wish to display your calendar on a web page.  You will have to grant make your calendar public for this option to work.\nCalendar Address\nClicking on \"XML\", \"ICAL\", or \"HTML\" in this section will generate a link to your calendar in those formats, that you can give to others to use to subscribe to your calendar.  For example, you could give the information generated by clicking on \"ICAL\" to someone who uses

work.\nPrivate Address\nClicking on \"XML\", \"ICAL\", or \"HTML\" in this section will generate a  link to your calendar in those formats, that you can use to subscribe to your calendar from an external program.  For example, if you use iCal on a  Macintosh, you could subscribe to your calendar from iCalusing the information from the \"ICAL\" button, and you would then be able to view your calendar from  within iCal rather than logging into Google calendar.  The information from the buttons in this section will grant access to all your events, so it's just for your use; do not give these out to anyone.  If you suspect that the information has been given out, you can click on \"Reset Private URLs\" to generate a new set of information for each button.\nShare this Calendar\nWhen

on your calendar, unless you specifically set a reminder.  You can click on \"Add a reminder\" to change the default to always send you a reminder (unless you specify something different in a specific event).  You can specify an email, pop-up, or text message (SMS) reminder.  The pop-up reminder only works if you have Google calendar open in your web browser.  The SMS option will only be available

These grouped messages are called conversations. Click here for more information on conversations. This feature is turned on by default. You can turn this feature off by going to Settings. Under General, look for the Conversation View setting and select Conversation view off.\nCan I delete just one email out of a conversation?\nWhile in the conversation, you can click on the drop down arrow on the far right of the message that you wish to delete and select Delete this message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tDeleting Messages in Google@UH Gmail\n\n\n\t\nWhere do deleted messages go?\n\n\nDeleted messages can be found in your Trash label.

Click here to read more about recovering deleted messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhat happened to my email folders?\n\n\n\tGmail doesn’t use a folder system. Instead labels are used to group and organize messages. Labels are more efficient for organizing your email because conversations can have more than one label and they can be searched for by label name. Click here for more information on labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow do I flag a message for follow-up?\n\n\n\tGmail uses a star system instead of flags. To star a message, click on the star icon to make the message stand out in your inbox. To view all starred messages click on the Starred link in the label list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhy do I have all of these extra contacts?\n\n\n\tBy default Gmail adds contacts that are not already in your contact list to your All Contacts list when you reply to, forward, or compose a new message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhat are the sending limits for Gmail?\n\n\n\tTo prevent spam and email abuse, Google has implemented a 2,000 message per day sending limit on all accounts. One email message may contain up to 500 recipients. Click here to learn more about Gmail sending limits.\nThe maximum message size for messages in Google cannot be greater than 25MB. However, you may experience issues if the recipients email service utilizes a smaller message size limit. To send large attatchments, we recommend that you send them utilizing the UH File Drop Service.\nGoogle also restricts the file types that may be sent through their services. These file types are not limited to but include, \".bat\", \".cmd\", \".com\", \".exe\", and \".sys\". Click here for a full listing of blocked file types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow do I increase my storage quota for Google@UH Gmail?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGoogle@UH accounts storage quotas are based on a person's affiliation.

Click here to learn more about Offline mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow do I sort my email in Gmail?\n\n\n\tCurrently, sorting by date/subject/from/to/etc. is not supported in Gmail. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow do I send a read/delivered receipt with a message?\n\n\n\tCurrently, read/delivered receipts are not supported by Gmail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhy don't I receive a copy of my own message when sending to a LISTSERV list?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGmail recognizes that the incoming message is identical to the copy in your Sent Items and does not duplicate it to your inbox.\nGoogle's recommendation is that you cc yourself when sending messages to a mailing list from your Google@UH Gmail account. Since you are unable to receive copies of your own messages, another available option is to enable the ACK setting, which is an acknowledgement email from LISTSERV that your message was sent to X number of recipients. In addition, if your list has archives enabled, you can see if your message was posted to the list by checking the archives..\nTo change your current ACK settings, you may do the following:\nA. Enable ACK in your subscription options\n\n    Under Subscriber Options in the navigation pane on the left, select Subscriptions.\n    Click on the name of the list you want to enable acknowledgements for.\n    Click on the menu button along the right-side of the page (it should look like three horizontal lines stacked together). Then, click on Subscribe or Unsubscribe.\n    In the Acknowledgements section, select Short Message Confirming Receipt. Then, click on Update Settings.\n\nB. Enable ACK as default for new subscribers (List Owners Only)\n\n    Under the List Management options in the navigation pane on the left, select List Configuration.\n    Click on the Subscriptions tab.\n    Select the list that you are modifying from the drop-down menu. Then, scroll down to Default-Options.\n    Add the keyword ACK to the text field. If there are already other keywords listed as Default-Options, simply add a comma followed by the keyword ACK to the end. Then, click on Update.\n\nC. Enable ACK for existing subscribers (List Owners Only)\n\n    Under the List Management options in the navigation pane on the left, select Subscriber Reports.\n    Select the list that you are modifying from the drop-down menu.\n    Click on Customize Report and check Acknowledgements. Then, click on Update.\n    Use the check boxes on the left to select specific subscribers (or click on Check All to select all subscribers) and, using the drop-down menu at the bottom of the Acknowledgements column, select Ack. Then, click Update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow Do I Prevent Emails From Being Incorrectly Marked as Spam When Using Google@UH Gmail?\n\n\n\n\tCreating a filter for a particular sender/subject/etc\n\n    Log in to Google@UH Gmail at http://gmail.hawaii.edu\n    Click on 'Create a filter' (or within a message select 'More actions', then 'Filter messages like these')\n    Enter the criteria for your filter then click 'Next Step'.\n    Select the checkbox 'Never send it to Spam' and click on 'Create Filter'. You may also select the checkbox 'Also apply filter to the xx conversations below', which will apply the filter to existing messages.\n\n \nCreating a filter to prevent any messages from going to Spam\nWarning: All messages which would have been labeled as Spam will be delivered into the Inbox.\n\n    Log in to Google@UH Gmail at http://gmail.hawaii.edu\n    Click on 'Create a filter' (or within a message select 'More actions', then 'Filter messages like these')\n    In the 'Has the words:' field, enter \"is:spam\" (without quotes), then click 'Next Step'.\n    You should see a prompt \"Warning: Filter searches containing \"label:\", \"in:\", \"is:\" criteria are not recommended\".

    "content": "Rather than using folders, Gmail uses labels.  There are many benefits in using labels as opposed to folders.\n\n    A message can have more than one label\n    You can search for messages by label\n    Reduce the number of duplicate messages\n\nHere are some of the basic tasks you can perform with labels.   \n\nCreate a label -You can create a label by clicking on the Labels drop-down menu, then select Manage labels.  Select Create new, type the name of your new label and select Create.  If you select multiple messages, or are viewing a specific email message, click on the Labels drop-down menu to display the option Create new.  After creating a new label, the new label can be selected by clicking on the Labels drop-down menu.  Any selected messages will be categorized with the label chosen from the drop-down menu. \n \nDelete/Edit a label -To Delete/Edit a label, select the Labels drop-down menu, and select Manage labels.  From the labels screen, you can show, hide, or remove any existing label.  If you select an existing label by name, you will have the option to change the name of the label.  Changing the name of an existing label will rename the label for any messages that were categorized under the label.  Deleting a label will not delete any messages that were categorized under the deleted label; e.g. a message that had been labeled as \"Inbox\" and \"Google\", would retain the \"Inbox\" label after deleting the \"Google\" label.\n\nSearch labels - One benefit of labels versus folders is that a message can be searched by label.  Messages can have multiple labels, which return better search results.  To search for a message by label, enter \"label:\" in the search box followed by the search criteria.  A list of your labels should display, you can select the appropriate label from the list of labels, or you can contiue typing.  Select Search Mail to search for the desired label.\nFor more information on labels go to http://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=12881 ."

    "content": "It is possible to send files to another person by attaching them to email messages. These files are referred to as attachments . Any kind of computer file can be an attachment: a word processing file, a spreadsheet, a database, an audio or video file, etc. However, please be advised that email with certain extensions are deleted due to security risks e.g. viruses or other damaging programs. For more information, please refer to: http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6590\n\nAlthough the recipient may be able to receive an attachment, the file is not usable if the recipient does not also have the appropriate program to read the file. For example, if you send an MS Word file to a person who uses Word Perfect, the recipient may not be able to use the file. Likewise, there are sometimes problems involved in sending files between PCs and Macs.\n\nIn addition, Google imposes a maximum email size limit of 25 MB. (As a caution, large files take up valuable quota disk space and should be off-loaded to your personal computer.) As an alternative, please see the File Drop service at: http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop for transferring large files.\n\nTo send an attachment: compose a message and click Attach a file (next to paper clip) on the tool bar. Use the browser to find the file to attach and click Open to attach the file. (If your files are large you may see a progress bar as your file is uploaded) To attach another file click on Attach another file and follow the same procedures. To remove an attachment , uncheck the box for appropriate file. \nIt is good practice to mention that you are sending an attachment and specify its format. (For example: \"I am attaching a spreadsheet in MS Excel 2003 format.\")\n\nTo receive an attachment: Read the message as you normally would. If there is an attachment, they will be displayed below the message. Depending on the attachment type, you may have several options to choose from. (Open as Google document, View, View as HTML, etc) You can also choose to Download the attachment to your computer, or if there are multiple attachments 'Download all attachments\" (in a zip file).\nFor more information on attachments, go to http://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=12834 ."

You may want to do this from time to time to archive old email, or if you are nearing your email quota.\nSetup Thunderbird for IMAP\nIf you haven't already, you first need to setup Thunderbird to connect to your hawaii.edu account via IMAP.  Please follow the directions in the askus articles below for either Mac or Windows:\nGoogle@UH Gmail Thunderbird (Mac) Setup\nGoogle@UH Gmail Thunderbird (Windows) Setup\nCreating local folders in Thunderbird\nThunderbird has three \"panes\".  The list of folders you have on the server will display in the left side pane.  Your Inbox index of messages will appear on the top right side.  If you click on a message, its contents will be displayed in the lower right side pane.\nThe first step in moving your email to your hard drive is to create local email folders.\n\n    In the list of folders on the left side pane, right-click on \"Local Folders\" and select New Folder\n    \n    The \"Create as a subfolder of\" should already be set to \"Local Folders\"\n    \n    In the \"Name\" box, type UH Email Archive, or some other descriptive name of your choice.  Click Create Folder.\n    \n    If necessary, click on the arrow next to Local Folders to expand it and display your newly created folder.\n    \n    Right-click on UH Email Archive (or whatever you named the folder in step 3) and select New Subfolder...\n    \n    Make sure the \"Create as a subfolder of\" is set to UH Email Archive (or whatever you named the folder in step 3).\n    \n    In the \"Name\" box, type Inbox.  Click Create Folder.\n    \n    Repeat steps 5 - 7 and create folders for all the different folders that you wish to copy off of the server (e.g. Drafts, Sent, Trash, etc.).\n\nWhen you are done, if necessary, click on the arrow next to UH Email Archive to expand and show what's stored inside.  Your Local Folders should look similar to below, except with your information:\n\n\nMoving email to your local folders\nYou should try the following steps on a small amount of messages first.  Be sure you are comfortable with this process before attempting to move a large amount of email or email from a critical folder such as Sent or Inbox. If you are also logged into your Google@UH Gmail in a web browser, it is recommended that you log out of the browser before beginning the steps below.\n\n    You first have to select the folder that contains the messages you want to move.  In this example, we will archive messages from the \"meetings\" folder.  On the left side of the screen, click on the folder \"meetings\" that's listed under the \"username@hawaii.edu\" section (do not select the one under \"UH Email Archive\").\n    \n    Select the messages you wish to archive. Use Shift+Click to select a number of messages in a row. Use Ctrl+Click to select multiple individual messages spaced apart. Use Ctrl+A (or Option+A on Mac) to select all messages in a folder. Note, selecting all messages in a folder with a large amount of email may result in slow performance.\n    \n    Right-click one of the selected messages and select Move To > Local Folders > UH Email Archive > and finally the meetings folder. \"Move To\" will move messages from one folder to another, while leaving an archived copy on the server. Select \"Copy To\" instead to make a local copy while leaving the message on the server in its original location. Note, selecting \"Copy To\" or \"Move To\" will not reduce your storage quota usage unless you later delete the messages from the server (in other words, delete the messages from your Google@UH Gmail or from Thunderbird under the \"username@hawaii.edu\" section).\n    \n    The highlighted messages will be moved to the meetings folder.  Depending on how many messages you selected to move, this could take some time.\n    \n    On the left side, select the meetings folder under the UH Email Archive section and verify the messages are there.  If you used \"Copy To\",Once you have verified that the messages were successfully moved, you may delete them from the server (in other words, delete the messages from your Google@UH Gmail or from Thunderbird under the \"username@hawaii.edu\" section).\n    \n    Repeat steps 1 - 5 for each of the folders that you wish to move off of the server.\n\nBacking up your archived email\nNow that you have an archive of emails stored on your local storage, you may want to make a backup to store on an external hard drive, thumb drive, other external media, or a cloud storage account.\n\n    \n    Right-click on the Local Folders folder in Thunderbird.\n    \n    \n    Select Settings.\n    \n    \n    Next to the Local Directory, select Browse...\n    \n    Copy the entire \"Local Folders\" folder to your external storage media (right click on the folder and select Copy, Right click in your media and select Paste). You may need to exit Thunderbird for the copy operation to complete. Be sure you are only copying the \"Local Folders\" folder and are not moving it. Moving the folder will result in you being unable to view the archived emails in Thunderbird.\n\nRestoring a backed up archive\nShould you need to restore archived emails that you had previously backed up, you will need to take the archive backup you have stored on your external hard drive, thumb drive, other external media, or cloud storage account, and copy it back to your local storage.\n\n    \n    Right-click on the Local Folders folder in Thunderbird.\n    \n    \n    Select Settings.\n    \n    \n    Next to the path shown at Local Directory, select Browse...\n    \n    Find the \"Local Folders\" backup that you stored previously and copy it to the directory shown in step 3 above. You may want to rename the folder in order to better distinguish between the items you are restoring and the items that may already exist in your Thunderbird's Local Folders.\n    \n    Restart Thunderbird and click on the arrow next to Local Folders to expand the folder and show your restored email."

    "content": "It is important when installing and maintaining a Microsoft Windows server to perform initial and maintenance security checks on the server. Below is a checklist of basic tasks that should be performed on each server on initial setup and monthly to ensure continued security of the server. Please note that adding additional services like SQL server requires additional tasks to be performed routinely.\nWindows Update - One of the most important steps when installing a new Windows server is to perform all of the critical Windows Updates. If possible install Windows from media slipstreamed with the most current service packs and install updates from media such as a DVD before connecting it to the network for the first time. If that is not possible ensure the Windows Firewall is turned on when you connect the server to the network to patch it.\nAntiVirus - Installing AntiVirus is an important step in securing your server. For servers that are part of the University of Hawaii, you can download and install McAfee at www.hawaii.edu/software  Verify that the server is getting updated virus definitions often.\nMS Baseline Security Analyzer - Download and run the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to find any potential holes or missed patches http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc184924\nWindows Firewall - Ensure that the Windows Firewall is turned on and that only the services and ports necessary are allowed for inbound and outbound traffic. Check this often and close ports that are no longer needed.\nChange network scanner default password - If there is a scanner attached to the network it is important to change the default password. You can find information on doing this in the manual for your model of scanner.\nIf IIS is on, restrict IIS by subnet - If possible limit access to IIS by subnet.\nAnonymous FTP - Evaluate if having anonymous FTP enabled is necessary for your server and if possible restrict access by IP address.\nRemove \"Everyone\" from data directories - When creating new shared directories, ensure that the \"Everyone\" group is removed from the share and security permissions.\nSet Administrator password to something difficult - For auditing and security measures it is best to reset the Administator password to something difficult like a passphrase and use separate Admin accounts per user. Do not disable this account as some functions can only be done as this user.\nCreate personal admin accounts - Create personal admin accounts instead of allowing everyone to use the same account. This will allow for better tracking in logs of who has made changes to the server.\nSet personal admin password to expire in 1 year - To ensure the continued security of the server, set the personal admin passwords to expire after a year to force admins to set a new password.\nUsing SQL Express - If using SQL Express, the built in administrator account \"sa\" by defaut has no password. You must install the SQL Management Studio to set the password.\nRename any accounts called \"backup\" - Rename any default backup accounts thathave a username that could be easily guessed by a hacker.\nMake sure \"guest\" account is disabled - Always ensure that the built in \"guest\" account is disabled.\nMake sure minimum services necessary are turned on  - In the server manager, make sure that only the services that you need are turned on for each server.\nPatch 3rd party software - Make sure that all 3rd party software (such as Adobe) are patched regularly.\nLogging - Turn on logging for services and applications. Review logs at least monthly for unauthorized activity.\nUnused Accounts - Verify that all usused accounts have either been removed or disabled.\nCheck Administrator group - Check this group to ensure no unauthorized changes have been made to membership.\nRelated Articles\nSecuring Linux Servers\nSecuring Mac Servers"

In order to protect the personal, confidential information it is entrusted with, UH must comply with local and state laws and federal requirements such as but not limited to: FERPA, HIPAA, PCI, FTC and FISMA.\nUniversity Data Governance and Data Classification Policies\nE2.215 Institutional Data Governance - Established to provide principles governing the management and use of data and information at the University, including, but not limited to, the collection and creation, privacy and security, and the integrity and quality of that data and information.\nE2.214 Data Classification Categories - Established to organize UH Institutional Data into data classification categories based on the different levels of security risk and penalties that may result from inadvertent exposure and inappropriate disclosure of those data. The categories are: Public, Restricted, Sensitive, and Regulated.\nOther related policies can be found here: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/\nData Categorizations:\nInstitutional Data—data the University of Hawai?i uses for administrative and academic duties—can be categorized based on different levels of security risk and penalties that may result from inadvertent exposure and inappropriate disclosure of that data.\n\n    Public: Institutional Data where access is not restricted and is subject to open records requests. This includes student directory information and public employee information.\n    Restricted: Institutional Data used for UH business only. Restricted data will not be distributed to external parties except under the terms of a written memorandum of agreement of contract. Examples include UH email, UH ID number and UH ID card.\n    Sensitive: Institutional Data subject to privacy or security considerations or any Institutional Data not designated as public, restricted, or regulated. Examples include student grades, student and employee date of birth and salary information. UH research data or other UH intellectual property is also considered Sensitive Data.\n    Regulated: Institutional Data where inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate access requires a breach notification in accordance with HRS §487N or is subject to financial fines. Driver’s license numbers, Social Security Number (SSN) and personal financial or health information fall within this category.\n\nAdditional examples can be found at: https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/institutional-data-classification-levels/ [UH Login Required].\nWhat is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) is the type of information that needs to be protected because the inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate access requires a breach notification or is subject to financial fines. Information such as Social Security Numbers, Driver’s License numbers or Hawai?i Identification Card numbers, Financial Account numbers, PCI-DSS information, and Health information, including anything covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are categorized as \"Regulated\" by the University of Hawai?i.\nMinimum Security Standards\nAs part of the UH Data Classifications (EP2.214) technical guidelines for each data classification category shall be followed to prevent the inadvertent exposure and inappropriate disclosure of Institutional Data that are considered protected data. The latest minimum security standards are available at https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/.\nDo you handle PII, \"UH Sensitive\", or \"UH Regulated\" data?\nAny UH employee or UH affiliated individual that accesses PII must acknowledge the online General Confidentiality Notice (GCN) found at https://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/. The General Confidentiality Notice identifies some examples of PII (note that it is not exhaustive). The document also identifies the responsibilities of people who have access to such information.\nYou will also need to take the Information Security Awareness Training found in Laulima. This brief course goes over various topics, such as data breaches, securing information, and UH policies. A link to the Security Awareness Training could be found here: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/training/.\nDo you store \"UH Regulated\" data electronically or in paper format?\nPer Hawai‘i State Law and UH Policy, any individual, department, or unit storing Personally Identifiable Information, regardless if it is paper or electronic, needs to be reported. For the University of Hawai‘i, this information needs to be reported in the Personal Information Survey site. The information survey MUST be reviewed and updated annually.\nInformation Security Program Requirements: Server Registration and Personally Identifiable Information Scanning:\nAny server operating on the University of Hawai‘i network (regardless if it is behind a firewall) must be registered in the Server Registration database, accessible here: https://www.hawaii.edu/its/server/registration/. Servers will also need to be scanned for vulnerabilities and personally identifiable information annually. More information on this requirement can be found here: https://hawaii.edu/askus/1312.\nPII Scanning with Spirion (formerly Identity Finder):  To determine if your server contains PII, a scan using Spirion or Find_SSN will be required. Spirion is available for Windows and Mac. To learn more, visit https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1297. To scan Linux or Solaris servers use Find_SSN: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1323.\nIf your server contains PII, ensure that a corresponding Personal Information Survey is filled out.\nScanUH:  This is a vulnerability scanning tool that will return a fairly detailed, technical report. To scan your computer or server for vulnerabilities, go to:  https://scanuh.hawaii.edu/.\nInformation Security is ALL OUR Responsibility\nRemember: Everyone is responsible for the privacy of protected information. This task should not be left for one person to accomplish. It requires everyone’s understanding and participation to be effective. Everyone should know and understand the procedures of securing data at the University of Hawai‘i.\nOther Links\n\n    UH InfoSec Website\n    UH Data Governance Website [UH Login Required]"

    "title": "Setting up Encryption in Windows",
    "content": "Encryption is used to secure data that others shouldn't be able to read; for example, social security numbers (SSN) or financial data. These are suggested methods for using encryption in Windows, but they should always be used with discretion and caution. (You don't want to lock yourself out from the information either.) It is also highly advisable to make a backup of your information before implementing.\n\nAs a best practice, whenever using encryption, create the necessary backups, recovery keys, certificate exports, etc. necessary to ensure you have a way to restore or recover your data.\n\nBitLocker - Full Disk Encryption\n\n    Windows 10 Professional provides disk encryption through BitLocker Drive Encryption. Microsoft describes BitLocker as, \"A data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers. BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline.\"\n\n\nContact site licensing at https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/ to ensure you purchase the correct version of Windows 10 to use BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\nIf you enable BitLocker Drive Encryption, it is imperative you backup the recovery key during setup. If you do not backup your recovery key, your data will not be recoverable.\n\n\nInternal Drive - Full Disk Encryption\n\n    Turn on BitLocker\n        \n            Type BitLocker in the Windows search box, then press Enter.\n            Select Turn on BitLocker\n        \n    \n    BitLocker Recovery Key Backup Options\n        \n            IMPORTANT: Be sure to record and keep this BitLocker recovery key in a safe place. You cannot access the data without this recovery key.\n            BitLocker gives you three options: Save to your Microsoft Account, Save to a file, or Print the recovery key. Choose the option that works best for you.\n        \n    \n    Select how much of the disk to encrypt\n        \n            Encrypt entire drive (slower but better for PCs and drives already in use)\n        \n    \n    Select Encryption Mode\n        \n            The ability to choose your encryption mode is a new feature in Windows 10. Select the encryption option that matches your situation. We recommend New encryption mode\n        \n    \n    BitLocker System Check\n        \n            It is recommended to run a BitLocker system check first before encrypting your drive. This ensures BitLocker can read your recovery key before starting the drive encryption.\n            When ready, select \"Start encrypting\" to begin the BitLocker process of encrypting your hard drive.\n        \n    \n\nExternal Drive (Portable HardDrive, FlashDrive) - Full Disk Encryption\n\n    Plug in your external drive to an avaialbe USB slot\n    Type BitLocker in the Windows search box, then press Enter.\n    Under the Removeable data drives - BitLocker To Go heading, Click Turn on BitLocker\n    On the Choose how you want to unlock this drive window, Check Use a password to unlock the drive\n    Create a strong password that will be used to unlock the drive\n    Backup your recovery key using one or more of the available options\n    Select Encrypt Entire Drive\n    Select Compatible mode if you will be using the exteranl drive on older Windows versions, otherwise select New encryption mode\n    Read the prompt, and then click Start encrypting\n    Do not move or make changes to files or unplug it while it is being encrypted\n\n\n\nBitLocker Resources\n\n    BitLocker and Windows 10 Pro Protect your data\n    Bitlocker Overview\n\n\nFile and Folder Encryption\nMicrosoft also offers the ability to encrypt files and folders in Windows 10. File and folder encryption can be done in addition with BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n    Below are steps on encrypting files and folders, backing up your personal certificate, and decrypting files and folders.\n\nEncrypting Files and Folders\n\n    Click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, then click on Windows Explorer\n    Locate and right-click on the file or folder* that you want to encrypt and click Properties.\n    On the General tab, click Advanced.\n    Under Compress or Encrypt attributes, select the Encrypt contents to secure data check box, and then click OK.\n    Click on OK to close the folders Properties window.\n    In the Confirm Attribute Changes dialog box, choose one.\n        \n            If you want to encrypt only the folder, click Apply changes to this folder only, and then click OK.\n            If you want to encrypt the contents in the folder along with the folder click Apply changes to this folder, subfolders and files, and then click OK.\n            If you want to encrypt only the file, click “Encrypt the file only” and click OK.\n        \n    \n    Windows will now proceed to encrypt your data. How long it takes depends on the amount and size of the files you choose to encrypt. When it is complete the folder will be encrypted. However, this does not mean that others cannot view the contents of the folder. Encrypting the files prevents them from opening items in the encrypted folder.\n\n\nNote: While it is possible to encrypt both files and folders, Microsoft's Best Practices suggest encrypting folders not individual files. This prevents applications from unintentionally removing the encryption from a file.\n\nThings to do after you encrypt your data\nOnce you have encrypted your files or folders, it is important to backup your certificate to not lose access should you forget your password. If you do not backup your certificate and subsequently forget your password, there will be no way to recover your data. Back up your certificate and store it in a secure location.\n\nBackup your Certificate\n\n    Start Microsoft Internet Explorer\n    On the Tools menu, click Internet Options\n    On the Content tab, in the Certificates section, click Certificates.\n    Click the Personal tab.\n        \n            Note: You may have multiple certificates listed. Click on each one until you find the certificate with the intended purposes field showing \"Encrypting File System\"\n        \n    \n    Click Export to start the Certificate Export Wizard, and then click Next.\n    Click \"Yes, export the private key\" to export the private key, and then click Next.\n    Ensure the checkboxes next to “Include all certificates in the certification path if possible” and \"Enable certificate privacy\" are checked and click Next.\n    Click the Password checkbox, set the Encryption to AES256-SHA256, enter and confirm a password, then click Next. This password is to protect the exported certificate.\n    Specify the location of where you want to save the certificate. You can back up to another location on your hard-drive or a USB drive. You can also back up the certificate to multiple locations.\n    Specify the destination, click Save, and then Next.\n    Click Finish. You should be told the export was successful. Click OK.\n    Click Close to close the certificates window, then click OK to close the Internet Options window.\n\n\nDecrypting Files of Folders\nDecrypting a folder uses basically the same process of encrypting the file, but in reverse order.\n\n\n    \n        Right-click on the folder or file you want to decrypt, then click Properties.\n    \n    Click Advanced\n    Click to clear the Encrypt contents to secure data check box to decrypt\n    Click OK to close the Advanced Attributes dialog box.\n    Click on ok to close the folders Properties window\n    If it is a folder, and it has files in it, the Confirm Attribute Changes dialog box appears. You can choose to decrypt only the folder, but this won’t decrypt any of the files in the folder.\n    If you want to decrypt all the contents of the folder, click Apply changes to this folder, subfolders, and files, and then click OK."

    "title": "Securing Linux Servers",
    "content": "It is important when installing and maintaining a Linux server to perform initial and maintenance security checks on the server. Below is a checklist of basic tasks that should be performed on each server on initial setup and monthly to ensure continued security of the server. Please note that adding additional services like MySQL or Apache requires additional tasks to be performed routinely.\nChoosing a Distro - Linux servers come in many flavors (distributions) and you should choose one that you are familiar with and suits your needs.  When choosing a distribution, you should note at what point in its life cycle your current distribution lies.  Distributions will typically state how long they will provide updates for their product and if you plan on using the server for longer than the time listed, you should schedule time to upgrade the system before the cutoff date or possibly look for a distribution with a longer life cycle.  Larger, more popular distributions are also recommended as distros with small developer lists and user bases are more likely to end-prematurely due to lack of funding or interest.\nInstalling Linux - When installing linux in a production environment, it is recommended that you only install the services and applications that are required to accomplish the task the server needs to provide.  Choose a custom installation if possible as “default installs” may install many extra programs and services that will not be used.  Vulnerabilities in these applications and services could be used to make your server vulnerable to attack.  ‘Server’ or ‘Minimal’ installs may be available depending on distro and should be leveraged for maximum benefit.\nSoftware Update - One of the most important steps after installing a new Linux server is to bring your server up to date by performing a software update. The software update process differs between linux distributions, so please acquaint yourself with the update program that your particular distro uses.  For reference, ‘apt’ and ‘yum’ are two popular package managers that are commonly used among current distributions. If the distribution you are installing from isn’t up to date, make sure to check that your firewall is set properly before updating to disallow access to your computer’s services as your updates are being installed.  Regularly schedule a time to run software updates to the system.\nFirewall - Ensure that your server’s firewall is turned on and that only the services and ports necessary are allowed for inbound and outbound traffic. Check this often and close ports that are no longer needed.  If possible, limit access to services by subnet or IP.\nSELinux – If not installed by your distro by default, install SELinux and set it to ‘enforcing’ mode.  You can disable individual policies as needed for your system but do not completely disable or set to permissive mode to bypass the SELinux rulesets.\nRestricting Services by Subnet/IP - If possible through service configuration, limit access to your services by subnet or IP address.\nLimit sudo use – Sudo is convenient, but requiring root login can make it more difficult for someone to get full access to the system.\n\nSet Administrator password to something difficult - For auditing and security purposes it is best to set user and the root passwords to something using upper and lower case characters, numbers, special characters and a length greater than 8.  Do not use the same password for multiple users (including root), and refrain from using words that can be found in a dictionary.\nSet Password Expiration - To ensure the continued security of the server over time, set passwords to expire after a year to force users to set new passwords.\nDisable/Remove Guest Accounts - Always ensure that all \"guest\" accounts (if any) are disabled or removed.\nService Accounts - Check out the shadow and password file to verify that accounts created for services cannot be used to login to the system.\nMinimal Services - make sure that only the services that you need are running on each server, and check that only the services you want are scheduled to be turned on at server reboot.\nPatch 3rd party software - Make sure that all 3rd party software installed on the system are patched regularly.\nLogging - Turn on logging for services and applications. Review logs at least monthly for unauthorized activity.  Many distributions have logwatching programs available that email log sumarries daily to the administrator.\nUnused Accounts - Verify that all usused accounts have either been removed or disabled.\nRelated Articles\nSecuring Windows Servers\nSecuring Mac Servers"

    "content": "This article is intended for Facutly/Staff who may have certain types of PI (personal information) located on a computer, running the Linux or Solaris operating systems.\nOverview:\nFind_SSNs is a piece of software written in python at VirginiaTech that searches a computers files for Social Security #'s and Credit Card numbers. It requires python version 2.4+ to run. By default Find_SSNs searches the following file types: doc, docx, xlsx, xls, rtf, zip, text files (e.g. html, xml, txt) and Open Office 2 documents. It can additionally search pdf files when the pdftotext binary is installed. (It's part of the poppler package.) We provide two versions of Find_SSNs: One that searchs pdfs and another version that doesn't search pdfs (in case you can't install the poppler package). Our instructions below will include the necessary steps to get the poppler package installed. \t\n\nThe Find_SSNs software webpage at Virginia Polytechnic Institute is located here: https://security.vt.edu/software/Find_SSNs.html \t\nThe full Find_SSNs documentation at Virginia Polytechnic Institute is located here: https://security.vt.edu/software/Find_SSNs/find_ssns_referance_manual.html \t\nFind SSN download: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns.tar \t\nFind SSN without pdf download: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns_nopdf.tar\nRequirements\nLinux:\n\n    Python v2.4+  Note: RHEL and Ubuntu with a default install come with python installed.\n    pdftotext binary, which is part of the poppler-utils package on both RHEL and Ubuntu.\n\nSolaris 10:\n\n    Python v2.4+\n    pdftotext binary which is part of the poppler package*. (if you need to search pdfs)\n\n*The poppler package is not a part of the default install on Solaris so needs to be installed from a third-party package (and it's dependencies). \tTo ease the process of installing poppler and it's deps. we've created a tar download which bundles the poppler package and it's dependencies together with a install script which will automate the process of installing the packages. \nThe script verifies that none of the packages it installs are already installed on the system and it installs the packages in the /usr/local directory structure.\nDownload the Solaris poppler install bundle here: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/poppler_install.tar.gz\nExtract it and run the 'install_poppler.sh' which will install poppler and it's dependencies if any are not already installed.\nInstallation:\nLinux: \n  Note:  While these install steps should work on any modern Linux distro we've only verified that they work on RHEL5, RHEL6 and Ubuntu 11.04.\n\n    Install Python, if not already installed\n    Install poppler-utils package\n    \n        On RHEL5 install it with this command: yum install poppler-utils\n        On Ubuntu install it with this command:   apt-get install poppler-utils\n    \n    \n    Grab a copy of Find_SSNs here: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns.tar\n    Extract the Find_SSNs to the root users home directory or somewhere else where only root has access to it.\n\n Note: If for some reason you can't install poppler-utils to scan pdf files you can grab a copy of Find_SSNs with pdf searching turned off: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns_nopdf.tar\n \nSolaris 10: \n\n    Install the poppler-utils package. By default it is not installed on Solaris, and will need to be installed from a third-party package (and it's dependencies).\n    Download the Find_SSNs package here: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns.tar\n    Extract the Find_SSNs package.\n\n  Note:  If you cannot install poppler and it's dependencies to search pdfs you can download a copy of Find_SSNs with pdf support turned off: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns_nopdf.tar \n \nBefore Scanning:\n\n    Ensure poppler-utils is installed\n    Ensure you are connected to the internet, so the program can download the latest SSN patterns\n    Ensure Python interpreter in your $PATH environmental variable.\n    pdftotext binary in your $PATH environmental variable. (unless you are using the version of Find_SSNs with pdf support disabled)\n\nReducing False Positives:\nFind_SSNs uses a few innovative methods to reduce false positives, but it *will* still find some false positives when it scans your computer.\n\n    We've found that the best way to reduce the number of false positives is to only scan locations on the servers that could hold PII information. For example, /home, /fileshare, etc...\n    We've included the false positives that Find_SSNs finds on a full scan of a default install of RHEL5 and Solaris 10 in the Find_SSNs packages in the directory named \"default_false_positives\".\n\nScanning:\nFor the full documentation on Find_SSNs, please refer to the Find_SSNs official documentation, located here: http://security.vt.edu/software/Find_SSNs/find_ssns_referance_manual.html. \nScanning your filesystem(s) for files that contain SSN or CC #'s is the same across all Unix/Linux boxes. \n\nTo scan your whole computer for SSN's and CC #'s use this command:\n \t\tpython Find_SSNs.pyw -p / -o /root/find_ssns/ -t csv -a \t\t\n \t\t\t'-p' indicates the starting path. \n    '-o' indicates the directory to output the scan results. \n    '-t' tells Find_SSNs that you want your results in a csv file. \n    '-a' tells Find_SSNs to search for both SSN #'s and CC #'s. \n    \n     \t \t \tNote: If you're receiving this error: \"Error - Cannot load SSA areas to groups information. Are you connected to the Internet?\" \n    Replace the URL in numbers.py line 89 to http://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/assets/find_ssn/areas_groups.txt\n     \n    Output Files:\n    \n        A csv file which lists the files that have suspicious numbers\n        A txt file which lists the filenames and the actual suspicious numbers.\n    \n    After reviewing the two output files they should be securely deleted from the computer."

    "title": "Voice over IP (VoIP) Service",
    "content": "VoIP Basics\n Voice Over IP (Internet Protocol) is the technology of transporting voice communications over IP networks.\n\nThe current UH Manoa telephone system relies on physical wires that directly connect your handset to a port on the UH Manoa telephone switch at Bilger Addition. A separate data network connects the computer to switches and routers in the building basement, which is then connected to the UHNet via fiber cabling. This separation of voice and data networks will change with the implementation of VoIP.\n\nWith VoIP, voice communications run as IP Packets within the data network.  A separate voice network is no longer needed.\n\nThe handset acts as a normal telephone handset - the only apparent difference is that it connects to the data side of the datajack via standard Ethernet cabling and has an IP address. Existing phone numbers, five-digit dialing and multiple line appearances will be kept with no changes.\n\nITS managed Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches in the building wiring closets will provide power to the IP Phones through the Ethernet cable and will continue to power the phones for at least 15-20 minutes during a power outage.\n \nHandsets\n VoIP Handsets behave identically to the currently installed handsets. One change would be that basic analog handsets will be upgraded to single line digital display VoIP handsets.  For more information about the phone sets and user guides, go to  www.hawaii.edu/askus/1405 \nThe handsets are powered via Ethernet, commonly referred to as Power over Ethernet, or PoE (802.3af). The Ethernet switches in the wiring closets will sense if a device is capable of utilizing PoE and only after it determines that it is, will power be sent. This delay and check protects equipment that is not PoE aware.  Accidentally connecting a computer or other non PoE device directly to the datajack will not cause any damage.\n\nAs much as possible, ITS will disconnect the Ethernet cable from the computer in the office, connect it to the IP Phone and then run a cable from the IP Phone’s PC port to the computer.\n\nAnalog Lines\n\nCurrent analog handsets will be replaced with a single line IP Phone. Analog lines for faxes, modems, conference phones, etc. will be provided over the IP network through analog gateways located in the main telecom closet in each building - thus no changes will be necessary for these devices.  Short downtimes will be required as jumpers are moved to the new equipment.\n \n \nAvaya Voice Mail \n The new Avaya voicemail system provides the following key features:\n\n    Unified messaging - Voice messages can be forwarded to your email mailbox\n    Reach me - Incoming calls can be forwarded up to three numbers when there is no answer to the phone *\n    Notify me - Text message, phone call,  and/or email notification can be configured when a new voice mail message is received *\n\n* Contact ITS at 956-6033 if you are interested in using these options.  For more information, see the FAQ at www.hawaii.edu/askus/1358\nQuick Reference Guide:   Avaya Aura Messaging (voice mail) quick guide for Manoa  or  support.avaya.com/Libraries/Msg/60/user/en-US/QRG/\nAvaya Aura Messaing Web Interface User Guide :  Avaya Aura User Guide\nNetwork Design\nThe VoIP network, while running on the same physical network equipment as the existing data network, is completely separate and isolated.\n\nAll IP Phones across campus will be on the VoIP network which utilizes private RFC1918 addresses. At no time is the VoIP network interconnected with the UHNet and thus the IP Phones cannot be reached via the Internet. No IP address changes will be required for computers, nor will any additional IP addresses from departmental allocations be used.\n\nThe Ethernet switch port that the IP Phone connects to also provides access to the existing data network. The existing data network will be set “untagged” while the VoIP network will be “tagged”. Tagging refers to applying an 802.1Q or VLAN identifier to the Ethernet frame. The IP Phone will look at the “tagged” frame for voice communications and pass the “untagged” frame out its PC Port and onto the computer. As the data network is “untagged”, plugging a computer directly into the jack will continue to function as it does now.\n\nVoIP bandwidth for a typical phone call averages about 16 kilobits per second in both directions.  Quality of Service (QoS) settings on all of the ITS switches from the building to the UHNet core will ensure that voice traffic is prioritized over any other traffic - thus even if an Ethernet port is fully utilized, the phone will ring and will be able to place a call with no effect to the sound quality.\n\nAs the IP Phones are powered by PoE Ethernet switches from a central location (wiring closets per floor), ITS will be able to provide at minimum a 15-20 minute runtime for the IP Phones in the event of a power outage. Certain locations may have longer run times due to the smaller number of switches and phones. Once UPS power is exhausted at any point throughout the network, IP Phones will not function.\n\nTypical Network Diagram\n \nFAQs\nWhy are we switching to IP Phones?\nMoving the phones towards a network based system opens up new services to our users and provides cost savings for the University.  \nWill there be any phone outages?\nFor IP Phone handsets there will be no outages for the users. Until the old handset is removed, it will continue to function.\n\nAnalog lines to faxes and conference phones will incur an outage of approximately 30 minutes as jumpers are moved at the building and at Bilger Addition.\n\nIf they wish, users may use the ethernet port on their IP phone to connect their computer and free up the ethernet port on the Telecom outlet for other devices.\n\nWill our network have to change?\nNo. Addition of the IP Phone will be transparent to your network. The existing data network that is currently coming out of the datajack will now show up on the PC Port of the IP Phone. No readdressing of any computers is necessary.\n\nWill ITS use up my IP address allocation?\nNo. The IP Phones uses RFC1918 private address space that is completely independent of your allocation. You will not see the IP phones on your network.\n\nWill the Phones work in a power outage?\nYes - ITS will power the phones from the wiring closets with Power over Ethernet switches that are UPS protected. ITS estimates that a typical runtime for the UPS will be at least 15-20 minutes. Some locations may run for a longer period of time.\n\nWill my fax machines and conference phones work?\nYes. These extensions and jack numbers will be identified and analog service will be provided.  These devices will incur an outage of approximately 30 minutes as jumpers are moved to the new cabling."

    "title": "Securing Network Printers and Multi-Function Devices",
    "content": "Network Printers and Multi-Function Devices (MFD) are common in offices because they provide the ability to copy, print, scan, and fax from one central machine that is shared by many.  The MFD's typically store information and are connected to the network, therefore security controls need to be enforced to protect the information being printed, copied, scanned, faxed, etc.  UH policy EP 2.214 Security and Protection of Sensitive Information defines security requirements when MFD's are used for protected data.\nThe following is a list of best practices that should be followed to harden Network Printers and MFD's.  This checklist is a guideline since the management interfaces for MFD's vary, so refer to the MFD's documentation or the vendor to ensure you implement the security controls available for the various models.\n\n    Change default Administrator password - Change the default passwords and SNMP community strings to complex passwords.  If possible the passwords should be changed at least annually.\n    Disable unneeded management protocols - Disable unused network protocols.  TCP/IP is necessary for the network device with restrictions.  SMTP, SNMP V3 and HTTPS  may be used for device management, updates, monitoring, and communications.  Other protocols provide potential for unauthorized access or compromise so they should be disabled if possible.\n    Assign a Static or Fixed IP - Network printers and MFD's should have a static or fixed IP.  This will provide protection in the event that the DNS cache is poisoned; print files will not be able to be redirected.\n    IP Filtering - If possible, restrict access to the MFD by allowing access to a specific set or range of IP Addresses.\n    Updates - To protect the network printer or MFD from known security vulnerabilities the firmware needs to be kept up to date.  To ensure that updates are applied in a timely manner the MFD Administrator should request automatic update notifications if the manufacturer offers them.  The MFD Administrator should also check for patches available to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Click on \"Search CVE List\" and enter your MFD or printer manufacturer/model.\n    Physical Security - If there is a hard drive in the MFD, physical access to the device should be restricted / secured to prevent unauthorized access / removal of the hard drive.\n    Data Security - If there is a hard drive in the MFD, enable encryption for data stored and data transmitted to and from the device.  The recommended encryption algorithm is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128-bit).  Also enable immediate and scheduled image overwrite to erase data from the hard drive and non-volatile storage.  Check the manufacturer's technical specifications to ensure the hard drive can be encrypted.\n    Authentication - Enable network authentication restricting Users access to authorized services and ensure Users can not access the MFD global configuration.\n    Secure Printing - If available, enable the secure printing option that holds the print job until the owner enters a pin to release the document.\n    Logging - Enable logging to capture job activity, User access, fax logging, configuration changes, etc.  The logs are necessary to identify malicious activity and in the event of a security incident, logs can assist with prosecution.  Logs should be reviewed for irregular activity that may be considered a security incident, for example transmitting large amounts of data after regular business hours or many failed log on attempts in a short amount of time."

    "content": "Malware – What is it and how is it distributed?\n(Malicious software)\n \nMalware is a generic term used to describe various types of malicious software designed to remotely exploit an electronic device without your knowledge and in most cases for financial gain.  There are numerous types of malware to name a few; viruses, worms, Trojans, keystroke loggers, spyware, and adware.  The increase in types of mobile devices, cloud computing, and social networks have increased the landscape for malware attacks.  Malware is constantly evolving and gets increasingly sophisticated making it more difficult to identify and contain.\n \nSome types of malware require some level of user interaction to initiate the infection process such as clicking on a web link in an e-mail, opening an executable file attached to an e-mail or visiting a website where malware is hosted.\n \nCheck out the Ask Us article on some malware definitions Differences Between a Virus, Worm, and Trojan Horse.\n \nA keystroke logger is a hidden program on your computer that will record each key pressed on your keyboard and transmits or saves the information for the attacker.  The attackers are typically collecting login information including passwords, credit card information and any information they can use for financial gain.\n \nSpyware is another type of software program installed on your computer without your knowledge.  It collects information on your Internet surfing activity.  The information is then used for marketing purposes or fraud.  The information can be used maliciously to collect login and financial information typed on the keyboard.\n \nAdware is embedded in software you download for free or at a low cost.  The intention is to display advertisements when you access the software.  Adware can also include the same properties as spyware.\n \nE-mail attachments and links are popular methods for attackers to install malware on computers.\n\n    A file attached to e-mail may have malware embedded in it, so when the file is opened the malware is released. \n\n\n    A malicious link in e-mail can activate a malware program embedded in the e-mail message or it may open a Web page similar to the correct page, but with malware embedded in it.\n\n  \nHow do I protect my computer from Malware?\n \nThe first thing you must do is build a defense against malware by installing Anti-virus and Anti-spyware software and keep it up to date Anti-Spyware Solution for Your PC.  Also, use a personal firewall to block unwanted connections to your computer when connected to the Internet.  This Ask Us article explains Personal Firewalls.  Keep your computers operating system and software up to date with the latest patches.  The rest is up to you to use safe Internet browsing practices.\n \nSafe browsing practices:\n\n    Use strong passwords\n    Never store logon information\n    Keep your web browser up to date\n    If you provide personal information:\n    \n        Make sure the site is legitimate and trustworthy\n        Verify the site is encrypting your information (HTTPS) at the beginning of the URL\n        Clear your cookies and cache refer to Ask Us articles Cookies & Cache\n    \n    \n    Do not click on links unless you know they are legitimate\n    Be wary of Internet downloads, innocent looking software or streaming media could contain malicious malware\n    Do not click on links or attachments in e-mails unless you can verify its authenticity\n\nThe University of Hawaii (UH) Information Technology Services (ITS) provides software, services, and technical support to protect the UH community against computer viruses and security threats.  Refer to the Ask Us article for detailed installation information  UH Computer Virus and Threat Information  \n What do I do if I think my computer is infected?\n \nRefer to the Ask Us article Infected Computer AskUs 562 for some information on what to do if your Anti Virus program identifies a virus and other signs that may indicate your computer has been compromised.\n \nAttackers also use e-mail to try to extract your personal information that they will use for financial gain.  These types of attacks are called “Phishing”.  This Ask Us article explains what Phishing is and how to identify it. Phishing at UH\n \nYou can subscribe to a list serve that sends out email notices of current phishing attacks sent to UH e-mail addresses, so you can avoid falling for the phishing attempt.  Click on this link to access the Phishing Notifications web site.\n \nFor additional resources on Information Security visit the Information Security Web Site http://www.hawaii.edu/infosec"

    "title": "Physical Device Security",
    "content": "The security of your data is only as good as the amount of physical access someone has to it. Most common security measures such as firewalls and passwords will be rendered useless if someone gains physical access to your device. With laptops getting smaller and lighter and with the increase in use of mobile devices like iPads, iPhones, and Android devices it is easier than ever to steal valuable personal and business related data. Below are some ways to help in safeguarding your devices from being stolen, and if they are stolen to make sure no one can access your data.\nThere are many different ways to secure your computer from physical locks to cameras that take pictures of someone that is trying to steal your computer. Some of these resources are free and some can be purchased on a subscription basis.\nComputer Locks\nThere are many kinds of physical locks you can choose from. These locks used to only be necessary for laptops, but now with the  small form factor of computers such as the iMac, you should consider  these locks for any desktop that is not in a secure location. You can choose from key or combination locks for devices that are moved around often. For some examples of laptop locks see www.kensington.com/kensington/us/us/s/1479/laptop-locks.aspx. The important part of using a laptop lock is ensuring that you secure it to something  like a desk leg that cannot be easily lifted. You should also ensure that the lock you purchase is compatible with your device.\nMobile Devices\nIt is important to note that physical locks are also available for a variety of mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone and Android devices. However, since these devices might not be convenient to physically lock, having a passcode is your first line of defense in securing your mobile device. Some devices allow you to set the passcode to wipe the device after a certain amount of incorrect attempts to enter the pin.\nComputer Alarms\nAnother way to protect your laptop from getting stolen would be to install an alarm. This alarm would work similar to a car alarm and would sound a loud noise if your device was in danger of being stolen. You can get these for both Mac's and PC's and they can be set up with either a physical device or software.\nLAlarm (Windows only software) Free for personal use: www.lalarm.com\nLaptop security alarms example: www.amazon.com/Belkin-F5L013-Laptop-Security-Alarm/dp/B000RPVHDC\nLaptop Security Cams\nLaptop security cameras work on motion sensors and will either upload pictures to a website or email the pictures to you when the motion sensor is activated. This solution should be used along with a physical lock.\nYawcam for Windows: www.yawcam.com/\nGawker for Mac: gawker.sourceforge.net/Gawker.html\nAdditional Laptop protection strategies can be found in AskUs article 927.\nDevice Locators\nThere are services available for mobile devices that will use the GPS locator to allow you to track them. This service requires that you have location services turned on for your device. If your device is stolen you can log onto a website and track the location of where it is and any movement. Some of these services allow you to send messages or to remotely wipe all of the data on your device as long as it is turned on and has a connection to the GPS.\nFind My iPhone: Free for Mac users and works in conjunction with iCloud. Can be used for iPhone, iPad, iTouch or your Mac. http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-my-iphone/id376101648?mt=8\nLojack: Subscription based commercial product for Windows. www.lojack.com/pages/laptop.aspx\nPrey: Open Source for multi platforms. preyproject.com/\nEngraving \nAs unappealing as it may be, physically engraving your name, University inventory number, or other very visible identifying information is a detterent to theft.  It makes it difficult to resell the stolen computer.\nPhysical Positioning of the Device\nIdeally, the computer or other desirable electronic device should be positioned out of the line of sight of windows and doors.  If the device is in plain view of window or door, the thief can easily see it when doing a reconnaisance.  Additionally, do not leave the screen on at night as the glow of the screen in a dark room is a dead giveaway."

For example, John Doe's current email address is jdoe@hawaii.edu. With first.last, John's email alias could be john.doe@hawaii.edu. It is also a more definitive way of identifying yourself to another colleague where they might know your first and last name, but not your eight character email name. This is an optional service being offered to faculty and staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow do I request a first.last email alias?\n\n\n\n\n\n\tStaff or Faculty may request a first.last by logging in at https://www.hawaii.edu/username with your UH Username and password. After logging in, click on the \"first.last Email Alias\" link and follow the instructions there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMay I pick any name for my first.last email alias?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYou may have only one first.last email alias active at any one time. The first.last email alias should be closely related to your full name. The following are guidelines for selecting your first.last email alias:\n\n    first.last\n    first.last.generation\n    first.m.last\n    first.m.last.generation\n    first.middle.last\n    first.middle.last.generation\n    middle.last\n    middle.last.generation\n\nYour first.last email alias may only use alphabets (a-z), dash and/or period. The first.last email alias is not case-sensitive so Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu is the same as jane.doe@hawaii.edu. The \"last\" part of your selected first.last email alias must reflect your legal last name on record, so if your last name is Doe, Doe must be the \"last\" part of your first.last email alias. Offensive language will not be allowed in your first.last email alias even if it spells out your name. Alternative first.last email alias combinations can be considered.\nName Changes and First.Last Alias\nIf your name has changed, you have the option to switch from the first.last email alias that was based on your previous name, and activate a new first.last email alias based on your new name. For example, Jane Doe has Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu but they have changed their name to Jane Smith. They can choose to activate Jane.Smith@hawaii.edu (if it is available) and their Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu alias would be removed.\nAdditional Assistance\nIf you have any questions, or run into any problems regarding your UH Username, feel free to call the ITS Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 or toll-free from neighbor islands at (800) 558-2669 for assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhat will happen to my first.last email alias when I leave UH?\n\n\n\n\tWhen you leave UH, your first.last email alias will be removed at the end of your grace period, unless you enroll in 'Ohana online services. Your first.last email alias will be made available for reassignment if you do not renew your annual enrollment to 'Ohana online services."

    "content": "The increasing amount of electronic waste (ewaste) generated in the current digital age, along with environmental and human health impacts that  can result from dumping or improper recycling of electronic equipment, is a major worldwide concern. Follow these best practices to insure that unwanted UH-owned ewaste is properly disposed of.\n\n    Securely Delete Data – Security of information is a major concern with electronic equipment; even an office copy machine may contain data that should be safe guarded. Relying on the Delete function or Trash folder on a computer to erase data is not a safe practice; review the ITS AskUs article Securely Deleting Electronic Information for steps that can be taken to insure that data is sufficiently erased from a variety of devices.\n    Check if others can use it – If the device is still usable after securely erasing it, issue an internal email or memo within the department to see if anyone has use for the unwanted equipment; if not, then advertise it as available on the UH Electronic Swap Meet, where surplus materials and equipment can be transferred between departments within UH. The Swap Meet also contains a section for listing of Wanted Items.\n    Verify Inventory – Prior to disposal of ewaste, contact department Administrative Officers (AO) or Fiscal Officers (FO) who may be responsible for the inventory of equipment; verification of ownership via the serial number or State Decal number on the equipment may be required.\n    Determine Best Disposal/Recycling Method – Always follow other established procedures for transfer or disposal of UH-owned equipment outlined in the AskUs article Disposal Guidelines for Unused UH Computer Equipment.\n\nA United Nations report suggests that production of waste electrical and electronic equipment could rise by as much as 500% over the next decade. According to a Waste Electrical and Electronical Equipment (WEEE) forum, 2021 had a total of an estimated 57.4 million tonnes of ewaste. Following these best practices is a positive step in slowing the impact that the use of electronics and their recycling will have on Hawaii’s ecosystem."

When storing and transporting documents to be shredded, there are some important steps you can take to ensure that none of the documents are misplaced or disposed of incorrectly. See www.hawaii.edu/calendar/manoa/2012/05/31/18544.html for information related to past shred days.\nDetermining What Needs to Be Securely Destroyed\nDocuments that contain any of the following sensitive information should be shredded securely and not recycled or thrown in the garbage. See www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266 for more information.\n1) Student records, including anything protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n2) Health information, including anything covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\n3) Personal financial information such as credit card numbers, bank account information, debit card numbers, etc.\n4) Job applicant records (names, transcripts, etc.)\n5) Social Security Numbers\n6) Dates of birth\n7) Private home addresses and phone numbers\n8) Driver license numbers and State ID Card numbers\n9) Access codes, passwords and PINs for online information systems\n10) Answers to \"security questions\" such as \"what is the name of your favorite pet?\"\n11) Confidential information subject to attorney-client privilege\n12) Detailed information about security systems (physical and/or network)\n13) Confidential salary information\n14) Information made confidential by a collective bargaining agreement\nStoring Sensitive Documents for Shredding\nWhen you determine that you have a document that needs to be securely shredded, it is best to do so immediately. If you do not have that option or must store the documents for a period of time until they are shredded, there are precautions you can take to ensure the information is kept secure.\n1) Store the documents in a location away from trash or recycling so it is not confused with material that can be placed in the garbage or recycling container.\n2) Secure the box or container that the documents are held in. Make sure it cannot be easily removed and is locked.\n3) Ensure that the chosen storage location is secure with locked doors and monitored access if possible.\n \nTransporting and Shredding of Sensitive Documents\nIf your shredder or shredding service is not located in the same location as where the documents are stored, it is important that the documents are transported securely to ensure no boxes get misplaced or lost along the way.\nBefore shredding any documents:\n1) Depending on your shredder type, make sure no items that are not  allowed are mixed in with the paper. This can include, but is not  limited to:\n\n    Metal, Clamps\n    CD’s, Floppy Disc\n    Cassette Tapes\n    Rubber Bands\n    Binders\n    Microfilm/X-Rays\n    Plastic Items \n\n2) For added security it is recommended to use a cross cut shredder that shreds the document into very small pieces.\n3) For an extra level of security, you can put the shredded pieces into separate bags.\nElectronic Files with Sensitive Information\nFor information on securely deleting electronic information containing sensitive information see www.hawaii.edu/askus/706."

Computers running unsupported software have increased risk of cyber security threats, such as malicious attacks and data loss.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nIf you have not already replaced your Windows XP machines (or upgraded to a newer operating system -- for newer hardware only), you are strongly encouraged to take action as soon as possible. ITS recommendations are posted at http://www.hawaii.edu/technews/notice.php?id=245108\n\nIf you have questions or need assistance, please contact the ITS Help Desk at 956-8883, email help@hawaii.edu or call toll free from the neighbor islands (800) 558-2669.\nThe US-CERT has also posted an Alert TA14-069A:   https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-069A-0\nIf ITS detects a compromised Windows XP system, it may be blocked permanently until the operating system is upgraded.\n \nIf you absolutely MUST RUN Windows XP:\n\n    Limit use of the computer to non confidential purposes - no credit card processing, no access to student or employee records, etc. unless absolutely necessary (e.g. part of your job responsibilities).\n    If you must access confidential/sensitive information, do not browse to non-work related web sites, click on links in unsolicited emails, etc.  Make sure your computer does not get infected/compromised.\n    US-CERT recommends that you get rid of Internet Explorer (because it will no longer get patches). Install an alternative, current browser and make it the default. Windows XP comes with Internet Explorer but it only supports up to IE 8, making the security features of later versions unavailable.\n    If the machine is being used to control laboratory equipment, it should not be used for routine email and web surfing.\n    Air-gap or isolate on separate networks the XP devices in order to protect more modern machines from being attacked by compromised XP devices; you might consider leaving XP devices off the network completely if network and/or Internet access is not needed.\n    Install the final Windows XP update so machines start their unsupported lives protected from the latest known vulnerabilities.\n    Fully patch Microsoft Office if it’s on the machine to reduce the chances of it compromising the device.\n    Uninstall unused third-party software. The older it is, the more likely it is to be vulnerable.\n    Consider disabling or uninstalling browser plugins for third-party software, and set the browser to ask what to do with PDFs, etc., rather than opening them by default.\n    Install up-to-date firewalls and anti-virus software.\n    Keep the computer on a trusted network behind a NAT router, which acts as a hardware firewall.\n\nRelated Links\n\n    ITS New Computer Purchase Recommendations\n    Free Antivirus Software for UH community\n\n \n \nAdditional information from Microsoft:\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2014/04/08/get-security-updates-for-april-2014.aspx\n \n\"Support for Windows XP has ended\nMicrosoft has provided support for Windows XP for the past 12 years. But the time has come for us, along with our hardware and software partners, to invest our resources toward supporting more recent technologies so that we can continue to deliver great new experiences.\nAs a result, technical assistance for Windows XP will no longer be available, including automatic updates that help protect your PC. Microsoft will also stop providing Microsoft Security Essentials for download on Windows XP on this date. (If you already have Microsoft Security Essentials installed, you will continue to receive antimalware signature updates for a limited time, but this does not mean that your PC will be secure because Microsoft will no longer provide security updates to help protect your PC.)\"\nMore information about the risks if you continue to use Windows XP:\nhttp://blogs.technet.com/b/security/archive/2014/03/24/cyber-threats-to-windows-xp-and-guidance-for-small-businesses-and-individual-consumers.aspx"

    "title": "Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability Information",
    "content": "(This information is being updated frequently - please check back often for any updates.)\nA major security vulnerability named Heartbleed was disclosed on April 7, 2014.   This vulnerability affects many websites on the Internet that use OpenSSL to encrypt  webpages (pages that start with https).  SSL, or  secure socket layer, is an Internet protocol which is designed to encrypt traffic over the Internet to hide sensitive information from prying eyes.  SSL is often used to encrypt passwords that are used to securely access services offered through a website.\nThis OpenSSL security issue allows the stealing  of information protected by SSL by revealing the private keys that protect the  confidentiality of the information.  Sites affected by the security vulnerability  can have login credentials stolen as well as other data that would normally be  protected by an encrypted SSL connection.  In addition, once an attacker has the private key  for a particular website, they can use the key to decrypt traffic previously sent to  the server prior to the bug being disclosed.\nIt is important to note that only specific versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable.  More detailed information  about Heartbleed can be found at:  http://heartbleed.com\nThe Washington Post offered a   reasonable summary of this vulnerability and impact across the Internet.\n \nSo what does this mean to you?\n\n  Do I need to change my UH username password?\nNEW! as of 4/14/2014, 2:30pm\nITS has assessed the impact of the vulnerability for the primary UH services. The list of services and the impact of the Heartbleed bug  is available at: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/heartbleed/index.php\nYou will need to login with your UH username and password to view the page.\nPlease note that individual campus or departmental applications are not listed here.  Check with your IT support staff for local service/application information.\nA few UH services were affected by the Heartbleed vulnerability.  Users of those services will be contacted directly to change their passwords.\nYou may also be notified by your campus or department to change your UH password if it may have been exposed through their server or service.\n \nWhat about my personal accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.?\nCNET is maintaining a list of the top 100 web sites and their status available at:  http://www.cnet.com/how-to/which-sites-have-patched-the-heartbleed-bug/\nIf you logged-in to any website listed as vulnerable or if you have been notified by the service, you  should change your password AFTER the website has been fixed. If you are not sure if a site was vulnerable,  or if it has been fixed, you can check the website using the Heartbleed test site:  http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/\nIMPORTANT! You should NOT use your UH username and password to login to any non-UH website!  If you did use your UH credentials to login to any vulnerable website, you should change your UH password using  the UH One-Step Password Change page:  https://www.hawaii.edu/username/userprefs/password_only.cgi\nYou may need to reset your UH password more than once if you used your UH credentials on   websites that are vulnerable AND used your new/reset password on a vulnerable website that has not yet been fixed.\nBe on the alert for phishing attempts!\nWatch for fraudulent email claiming to be from UH or other companies with which you do business.  Criminals will use this as an opportunity to create targeted phishing email messages to trick people into  divulging their passwords.  Information Technology Services (ITS) will NEVER ask for your password in an unsolicited  email. Be on the lookout for  sites that purport to tell you whether your site or your information has been compromised, especially if  they demand personal details, login credentials, or payment.\n \nFor System Administrators:\n\nIf you are a system administrator with OpenSSL installed, please see:  http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1575  for more information. \n \nLast updated:  April 14, 2014 02:30 PM HST"

    "title": "Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability Information for System Administrators",
    "content": "On April 7, 2014, a serious vulnerability in the OpenSSL cryptographic software  library was exposed. This weakness, dubbed The Heartbleed Bug, allows  a remote attacker to access system memory which may contain encryption  keys, user credentials or other sensitive information. \n\nOpenSSL  provides communication security and privacy over the Internet for many  applications, including web, email, instant messaging (IM) and some  virtual private networks (VPNs).\n\nWhat is the risk?\n\nThis bug has left large amounts of  sensitive data exposed to attackers. Exploitation of the Heartbleed bug  leaves no trace, and thus requires everyone to take this exposure  seriously. \n\nIn a worst-case scenario, leaked encryption keys  allow an attacker to decrypt traffic, both current and past, to the  protected services. An attacker may also impersonate the service at  will.\n\nRead the full story online: http://heartbleed.com/\n \nIf you have servers that are vulnerable to this attack, please remediate as quickly as possible following these steps:\n\n    Update the OpenSSL code as required\n    Replace the public/private keys and associated SSL/TLS certificate associated with that server/those servers, revoking the earlier (now potentially compromised) SSL/TLS certificate(s).\n    Review the configuration of each SSL/TLS server using:  https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ evaluation page (note that you can check the box \"Do not show the results on the boards\" should you desire to do so).\n    As part of reviewing those results, you may want to consider enabling ciphers that support Forward Secrecy (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy for basic background).  Please note that enabling this feature may have unintended consequences (such breaking your application).\n    If the server was used to login to access secure services and passwords may have been exposed, you may need to notify your users to change their passwords.\n\nIf you cannot remediate your server and it is being used to access sensitive information, ITS may block access to the server until it can be remediated.\n\nAdditional references:\nhttp://threatpost.com/openssl-fixes-tls-vulnerability/105300\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/heartbleed-serious-openssl-zero-day-vulnerability-revealed-7000028166/\nhttp://www.itnews.com.au/News/382068,serious-openssl-bug-renders-websites-wide-open.aspx\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2165-1/\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0376.html\nhttp://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2014-April/020249.html\nhttps://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/announce/2014-April/003205.html"

The unit is housed at our campus telephone switch and is designed to provide access to an in-house conference bridge, eliminating the need to contact conference service bureaus.\n    How does the Audio Conference Bridge Work?\n    To use the Conference Bridge, the participants dial a pre-assigned phone number, enter a password, and are prompted to \"speak their name\". Your conference bridge will be available at the start time requested so please make sure that all participants do not call in before the start time. An individual may leave a conference in progress at any time.\n        The Audio Conference Bridge Features.\n        \n            Meet-me style conferencing (conferees join the conference at a pre-arranged time)\n            Password protection\n            Entry/Exit voice announcements\n        \n        How do I request the use of the Audio Conference Bridge?\n        You may request the use of the Meridian Integrated Conference Bridge by sending an email to telecom@hawaii.edu with the following information:\t\n        \n            Date\n            Start and End Time\n            Contact Name and Phone Number\n            Department name\n            Number of Participants\n            An email will be sent to you confirming your conference request along with the conference numbers and password. Please allow us 1 (one) business day notice to process your request.\n        \n        Why Would You Use the Audio Conference Bridge?\n        The conference bridge has the ability to connect individuals located on the neighbor islands, on the mainland US, or in another country, as long as one of the conference bridge participants is a faculty or staff of one of the campuses across the UH system. This person will be responsible for the phone charges to the department.\n            What is the Cost to Use the Audio Conference Bridge?\n            There is no cost to use the Conference Bridge.\n                Summary\n                \n                    At least one conference bridge participant must be a faculty or staff of one of the campuses within the UH system to be the contact person and to take responsibility for any charges to the department.\n                    30 minutes minimum - 12 hour maximum (reserved in 15 minute increments)\n                    6 participants minimum - 20 participants maximum\n                    Request must be made 1 (one) business day in advance.\n                    If you have questions or would like to discuss this service, please call ITS Telecommunications at 956-6033"

    "content": "Here are some tips to help you avoid being a victim of phone and email phishing scams:\n\n\n     UH will NEVER ask for your credentials, including password verification, via an UNSOLICITED email or phone call.  Any UNSOLICITED email or voicemail requesting you to do so should be treated as a potential phishing attack.\n    If you receive a call from the IRS, local police agency, or other agency claiming that you owe money, hang up the phone.  If you are unsure of whether or not the call was legitimate, you can call the number back at the agency's public phone number that you acquired from a legitimate source.    \n    Be aware of “spoofing,” a practice in which a person can change the phone number that appears on your caller ID.  A call may look as if it is coming from a police agency, even when it isn’t (spoofing is also used in email scams).\n    Keep your credit card, checking account, and Social Security numbers to yourself. Don't tell them to callers you don't know — even if they ask you to “confirm” this information. That's a trick.\n    If you receive a “special offer,” research it with your consumer protection agency or state Attorney General’s office before you agree to send money.\n    Beware of offers to “help” you recover money you have already lost. Callers that say they are law enforcement officers who will help you get your money back “for a fee” are scammers.\n    UH will never ask you to modify your inbox or adapt security measures via an email link. Any email requesting you to do so should be treated as a potential phishing attack.\n    If you receive an email from an unrecognized source, please exercise caution in dealing with its content. Do not open attachments unless you know it is safe to do so.\n    If you receive an email, either from an external or internal contact that you suspect may be a phishing attempt, please notify Information Technology Services at: phishing@hawaii.edu\n    Save any suspicious emails or phone messages to report to your local law enforcement agency.\n    If you feel that you have been a victim of fraud, please report it to your local police department.\n    \n\n \nAdditional information about Phishing at UH can be found in:  http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/966"

    "content": "Under an agreement with Google, the University of Hawaii (UH) offers two types of Google applications through Google@UH: Core applications (Core Apps) and Consumer applications (Consumer Apps). To use the Consumer Apps with your Google@UH account, you must first turn on the Consumer Apps at http://www.hawaii.edu/google/extra. Instructions to turn on the Consumer Apps are at http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1649.\n\n    Google@UH Service Availability Matrix\n     \n    What are Core Apps vs. Consumer Apps?\n    \n    Why is there no \"Turn off Consumer Apps\" button?\n    \n    Why can't I opt-in to Consumer Apps?\n\n\n    What happens after you turn on Consumer Apps for your Google@UH account?\n    \n    Why would you want to opt-in to the Consumer Apps with your Google@UH account?\n    \n    How do the Google@UH Terms of Service differ from the Consumer Apps Terms of Service, besides \"no ads\"?\n    \n    Are there any privacy or security implications with turning on Consumer Apps?\n    \n    What is the difference between Google Groups (Core Apps) and Google Groups (Consumer Apps)?\n    \n    What happens when you have a personal Google account already using some of the Consumer Apps?  If you opt-in, is the existing \"personal\" data, considered \"belonging to UH\"?\n    \n    What happens to Consumer Apps data when user leaves UH or when UH Username gets disabled/deprovisioned?\n    \n    If you share Consumer App data under your Google@UH account with other accounts, do the other accounts still have access after your Google@UH account is deprovisioned?\n    \n    What happens when you try to access a Consumer App with your Google@UH account but have not turned on the Consumer Apps?\n    \n\n   \nGoogle@UH Service Availability Matrix\nFor a complete and interactive list of Google apps and their features that are avaialble as either Core or Consumer apps, please visit our Google@UH Service Availability Matrix at https://hawaii.edu/itsdocs/google-availability/?app=all&aff=all&core=on&consumer=on.\n\n\nWhat are Core Apps vs. Consumer Apps?\nCore Apps are governed by a master agreement between UH and Google, and are available through Google@UH to all UH accounts. Core services include:\n\n    Gmail\n    Calendar\n    Drive\n    Groups (UH-only account collaboration)\n    Sites\n    Contacts\n    Classroom\n    Hangouts (classic)\n    Chat\n    Meet\n    Keep\n    Google Chrome Sync\n\n\nConsumer Apps include applications which are governed by either Google's general Terms of Services or by app-specific terms. All of the Consumer Apps fall under ITS \"best effort\" support, as described in the ITS Computer Support Policy.\nThe list of Consumer Apps will vary, as Google adds new Apps or retires Apps or as demand for existing Apps drives a change to our inventory. Once you \"turn on\" the Consumer Apps for an account, any changes to the inventory of Apps (additions and subtractions) would be immediately available with no further action on your part.\n\n    Blogger\n    Chrome Remote Desktop\n    Chrome Web Store\n    Colab\n    Currents (service is migrating to Spaces in 2023) https://support.google.com/a/answer/11203022\n    Google Alerts\n    Google Analytics\n    Google Arts & Culture\n    Google Bookmarks\n    Google Cloud Platform\n    \n    Google Cloud Print\n    Google Custom Search\n    Google Data Studio\n    Google Developers\n    Google Earth\n    Google Groups (all account collaboration)\n    Google Maps\n    Google My Maps\n    Google News\n    Google Photos\n    Google Play (free apps only)\n    Google Search Console\n    Google Takeout\n    Google Translate\n    Material Gallery\n    Pinpoint\n    Scholar Profiles\n    Search and Assistant\n    Tour Creator\n    Youtube\n\n\n\nWhy is there no \"Turn off Consumer Apps\" button?\nOnce the Consumer Apps is turned on for your Google@UH account, you do not have an option to turn them off. Please carefully weigh the pros and cons before turning on the Consumer Apps.\n\n\nWhy can't I opt-in to Consumer Apps?\nGoogle@UH Consumer Apps have certain restrictions that may prevent you from opting in. One such restriction is that individuals under the age of 18 are unfortunately unable to opt-in to Google@UH Consumer Apps. If you need access to Google@UH Consumer Apps and are unable to opt in, please contact the ITS Help Desk by phone at (808) 956-8883 or by email at help@hawaii.edu. They can provide you with more information, as well as steps you can take to gain access to these apps.\n\n\nWhat happens after you turn on Consumer Apps for your Google@UH account?\nAfter turning on the Consumer Apps, the first time you log in to your Google@UH account to access any Core App or Consumer App, you must agree to Google's Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy before you can proceed. Your use and access of the Core Apps will continue to be governed under the terms of UH's master agreement with Google, even after you turn on Consumer Apps.\nPlease note that some Google@UH Consumer Apps, such as Google Currents, have age restrictions that are handled separately from the overall Google@UH Consumer Apps restrictions. If you meet the requirements to opt into Google@UH Consumer Apps, you should be able to access these individual apps. However, when creating a profile in apps like Google Currents, you will be prompted to input an age. Inputting an age that does not meet Google Currents' age requirements will lock you out of your Google@UH account, including all Core Apps. If this happens, please contact the ITS Help Desk.\n\n\nWhy would you want to opt-in to the Consumer Apps with your Google@UH account?\nMainly, it's for data consolidation, convenience, and extended utility of your Google@UH account.\n\n\nHow do the Google@UH Terms of Service differ from the Consumer Apps Terms of Service, besides \"no ads\"?\nThe primary differences are 1) Google's Terms of Service gives Google the \"license to use\" your data from those Consumer Apps and 2) you, not UH, would be responsible for any legal disputes regarding your data or use of Google's services. The UH Google Agreement does not specify an allowance for a \"license to use\" your data provided to or through any of the Core Apps.\n\n\nAre there any privacy or security implications with turning on Consumer Apps?\nYes, whenever you upload, submit, send or receive content to or through a Consumer App, you are giving Google permission to use, host, store, reproduce, and modify, publish and distribute that content, although it does not provide to or grant Google any ownership interest in the content. If you use YouTube, you are granting Google and any user of YouTube permission to reproduce, distribute, display and perform your content in YouTube.\nGoogle collects, analyzes, and uses information you supply by or through using the Consumer Apps, which may include information on the devices you use, your actual location when using them, and the search queries inputted while using them. Please be aware that because you are allowing Google to use certain information, you may be deemed to have waived certain privacy rights you may have under other laws, such as Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), to keep the information private.\nGoogle's automated system will analyze your content to provide you with personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Google Groups (Core Apps) and Google Groups (Consumer Apps)?\nAll members in Google Groups (Core Apps) must have UH Usernames. Members in Google Groups (Consumer Apps) may include users with non-UH accounts.\nGoogle Groups under the Core App will have an address structure like group-name-grp@hawaii.edu. Google Groups under the Consumer App will have an address structure like group-name@googlegroups.com.\n\n\nWhat happens when you have a personal Google account already using some of the Consumer Apps?  If you opt-in, is the existing \"personal\" data, considered \"belonging to UH\"?\nThe data uploaded, submitted, or sent to a Consumer App via your personal account will remain linked to that account. Outside of sharing the data within the Consumer App from one account to the other, the data should be maintained independently from your Google@UH account data.\n\n\nWhat happens to Consumer Apps data when user leaves UH or when UH Username gets disabled/deprovisioned?\nFor disabled accounts, Consumer Apps data remains within the Consumer App and linked to the account. The disabled account will not be able to access any Core App or Consumer App while disabled, so the data may not be available to the account until it is re-enabled.\nThe data in the Consumer Apps would be permanently deleted when the Google@UH account is permanently deleted.\n\n\nIf you share Consumer App data under your Google@UH account with other accounts, do the other accounts still have access after your Google@UH account is deprovisioned?\nOnce your Google@UH account is deleted, all data linked to your account will be inaccessible. Prior to your account deprovisioning, you should ensure that any data which is still needed by other accounts is transferred to be linked/hosted to another active account. We are not able to recover inaccessible or deleted Consumer Apps data.\n\n\nWhat happens when you try to access a Consumer App with your Google@UH account but have not turned on the Consumer Apps?\nYou will get an error message saying that your Google@UH account does not have access to the Consumer App, the Consumer App service is not available for your organization or similar error message.\nSample error message for YouTube\n\nSample error message for Google Groups (Consumer App)"

    "title": "Updating WordPress on Hosted Departmental Sites",
    "content": "Setting Administration over SSL\nBefore starting any updates, the first thing you should do is setup 'Administration Over SSL' for your wordpress site.  This is because if updates are done using http, your authentication information could be transmitted unencrypted and potentially be stolen. To do this, add the following line to your wp-config.php above the line:  /* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */\ndefine('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);\nNote that your domain will need to be SSL enabled to use this setting so if you are using your own special subdomain (ex. program.campus.hawaii.edu, and https://program.campus.hawaii.edu does not work for you) you may need to buy a certificate for the domain you are using to securely update your site.\nDownload SSH SFTP Updater Support Plugin\nTo enable WordPress One-Click update for your site, you will first need to download the wordpress plugin SSH SFTP Updater Support.  To get the plugin, click the download link at: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ssh-sftp-updater-support/ .  After downloading, uncompress the .zip file you receive and place the folder named \"ssh-sftp-updater-support\" somewhere in your computer's work area, for example the desktop.\nUpload Plugin to Site\nNext, you need to upload this plugin to your site.  Connect to webedit with your preferred sFTP client, you should have received your connection settings via email when your site was created.  Go to your site's directory and upload the folder named \"ssh-sftp-updater-support\" from your work area to your site's wordpress plugin directory.  To get to this directory, first go to your site's home directory, then look within your site's structure for a directory named /wp-content/plugins/. (ex. if your site is located at /1/mysite, the plugin directory would typically be located at /1/mysite/wp-content/plugins).  Once there, upload the whole \"ssh-sftp-updater-support\" directory from your computer's work area to the \"plugins\" directory.\nActivate Plugin\nAfter uploading, log into your wordpress site and click on Menu Item at the left named \"Plugins\".  Find the plugin named SSH SFTP Updater Support in the list and enable it by pressing the Activate link as shown below.\n\nStart Update\nAfter activation, go back to your Dashboard, and either click on the Menu Item \"Updates\", or click on the link labeled \"Please update now\" to go to WordPress Updates.  After the page loads, click the button named \"Update Now\" as shown below to begin the update process.\n\nOn the Update Screen, first make sure your \"Connection Type\" at the bottom is set to SSH2. (webedit does not support FTP or FTPS connections)\nAfter that is set, please use the following settings:\nHostname: webedit.its.hawaii.edu\nFTP/SSH Username: <your UH Username>\nFTP/SSH Password: <your password> (note: your UH email password, not your WordPress password)\nThe Private Key setting should be left blank.  After this, press the \"Proceed\" button at the bottom of your screen.\n\nUpdate Plugins / Themes\nThis will begin the update process.  A screen will describe what's being updated on your site, and when that is completed it will bring you back to your WordPress Dashboard.  Make sure after you update WordPress, you go back to WordPress Updates, (Updates in the Left Menu, or a circular arrow icon with a number at the top of your screen) and update your Plugins and Themes as well.  To do this, check the checkmark next to the plugins/themes that needs updating, then press the Update Plugins/Update Theme button.  The plugin/theme update process will be similar to the wordpress update process you've just gone through.\nTroubleshooting\nIf the Auto-Update fails, and your site displays a message saying it is unavailable for scheduled maintenance, delete the .maintenance file from your site's home directory using your sFTP client and try again.\nAnother common occurence in failed site updates is a configuration themes sometimes add to a site's wp-config.php file.  The setting of FS_METHOD to 'direct' doesn't allow sites to update via sftp. To remedy this, comment out the line by adding two slashes '//' in front of the line, and start the update process again.  After doing updates, remove the slashes as it may be needed by the theme to perform certain functions.\nBefore:\ndefine ( FS_METHOD , 'direct' );\n\nAfter:\n//define ( FS_METHOD , 'direct' );\nShould you continue to have issues updating, please contact the web group at web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu with information about what step in the process is failing along with any error messages that appeared during the update process.  Taking screenshots of the errors you run into is usually very helpful for us to help diagnose your problem."

    "content": "Google is looking to phase out less secure apps in 2024, users should move to more modern apps or setup app specific passwords for legacy applications.\nMore information can be found at https://www.hawaii.edu/its/alerts/?t=4&id=10100\n \nGoogle may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. Since these apps and devices are easier to break into, blocking them helps keep your account safe.\nSome examples of apps that do not support the latest security standards include:\n\n    The Mail app on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 6 or below\n    The Mail app on your Windows phone preceding the 8.1 release\n    Some Desktop mail clients like Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird     \n    \n        Mozilla Thunderbird 38.0.1 and newer support the latest security standards\n        No current version of Outlook supports the latest security standards\n    \n    \n\nChange account access for less secure apps\nTo help keep Google Apps users' accounts secure, Google may block less secure apps from accessing Google Apps accounts. As a Google Apps user, you will see a “Password incorrect” error when trying to sign in. If this is the case, you have two options:\n\n    Upgrade to a more secure app that uses the most up to date security measures. All Google products, like Gmail, use the latest security measures.\n    Go to Allow less secure apps and choose “Allow” to let less secure apps access your Google account. We don't recommend this option because it may make it easier for someone to gain access to your account. But some cases where you still might want to allow apps access include:\n\nIf you want to continue using an app you’re familiar with. For example, if you have a Samsung phone and check your email messages with the app that came on the phone, you can choose “Allow” to continue using it."

As long as your mobile device has mobile network or wi-fi service, authentication requests can be pushed to your device via the Duo Mobile app.  You can download the Duo Mobile app to an iOS or Android device that meets the minimum requirements.\n\n    \n        \n            iOS\n            Please see https://guide.duo.com/iphone for the supported version of iOS\n        \n        \n            Android\n            Please see https://guide.duo.com/android for the supported version of Android\n        \n    \n\nOnce you have downloaded the Duo Mobile app and registered your mobile device, authentication requests will be \"pushed\" to your device through the Duo Mobile app.  You would then open the Duo Mobile app and tap on \"Approve\" or \"Deny\" to approve or deny the authentication request.\nDuo Passcode via the Duo Mobile App\nThe Duo Mobile app can be used to generate a passcode that can be used to login. Passcodes can be generated without requiring internet access, and can be used even if your mobile device is in airplane mode or otherwise not connected to a WiFi or mobile network with internet access. This is a great option to use when traveling or when in areas where access to the internet might not be guaranteed.\nPhone Call\nYou can opt to authenticate via a phone call to a landline or mobile phone.  When it's time to authenticate, you will receive a call on your registered phone number.  You would then push \"1\" on your phone's keypad to authenticate, or push \"9\" to deny the authentication request.\nRegarding phone numbers beginning with \"+86\"\nITS has been informed by Duo that due to recent telephony restrictions by the Chinese government, Duo is no longer able to authenticate by phone calls to users with +86 numbers.  If you have a +86 phone number registered in Duo, you will see the following notice:\n \nOther methods, such as Duo Push, SMS passcodes, or hard tokens will still work.  For more information, please refer to the following Duo knowledgebase article:\nhttps://help.duo.com/s/article/5001\nSMS Passcodes\nIf you do not have a smartphone, but you have a mobile phone with SMS/text messaging capabilities, you can use SMS passcodes to authenticate. When requested, a set of 10 passcodes will be sent to you as a text (SMS) message to your phone.  Each time you authenticate, you would use the next passcode in the sequence. After you've used all 10 passcodes, you can request a new set of 10 passcodes. You can also request a new set of 10 passcodes at any time. After you've requested a set of 10 passcodes, you can continue to use all of the passcodes in succession to authenticate even if your mobile device is no longer connected to mobile network.\nYubikey Hard Token\nA hard token (sometimes called an authentication or security token) is a hardware security device that is used to authorize a user.  UH provides Yubikey hard tokens for purchase.  The UH hard token is a usb device and must be inserted into your usb port to be used.  You would then touch the hard token anytime you wanted to authenticate.  If you do not have an available usb port, you cannot authenticate with the UH hard token. Hard tokens are not recommended and should be purchased only if you cannot use any of the other above means for authenticating.\nFor information on purchasing a UH hard token, please visit https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/"

    "title": "Mobile Phishing",
    "content": "People enjoy the convenience of their mobile device to read e-mail, check account balances, and pay bills. It’s possible to become a victim to a phishing scam while on a mobile device. Sometimes it could be difficult to tell you are on a phishing site because the regular techniques to check for a phish on a mobile device is not apparent. For example, in the image below, it would appear that we are on PayPal’s website to log in to our account. However, if we examine the URL closely, we see that we are on paypal-service-update-your-information. This is suspicious because although paypal is in the first part of the URL, we can't tell if it really is PayPal’s site.\n \n  \n \nIf you were to examine the full link, you would see that we are not on the paypal.com website, but instead on one controlled by the cybercriminal. When you are unsure or want to double check what page you're on, it's best to look at the full URL. See tip number 2 below to learn how. Checking the full URL is important because cybercriminals could make copies of popular websites to trick you into thinking that you are on the legitimate webpage.\nAnother example of this is below. This one is trying to trick you into thinking that you are on Google’s login page. The cybercriminal is relying on your mobile browser to hide the full URL of the page that you're on. In the first picture below, it would appear that we are on mail.google.com. However, if you tap into the URL bar to examine the URL closely, you will notice that you are really on com-secretsite's website which is shown in the second picture.\n \n   \nTips\n\n    Before clicking on links, tap and hold the URL to view where it’s going.  This ensures that the link is really taking you where it says it is. If the link looks suspicious, it’s best to not click on the link. This technique works in web browsers and email apps.\n    \n        \n    \n    When on a web page, check the URL bar to ensure you are on the page you should be on.  Cybercriminals craft links to impersonate legitimate sites and services. If you're unsure if you’re on the right page, tap in the address bar and swipe left to right to view the full URL. To verify the true website that you’re on, look for the last period before the first forward slash. The words to the left and right of that period is the web site you are on. \n    \n    For example, in the image below, the full URL is artsci.manoa.hawaii.edu/. The word to the left of the last period is hawaii, and to the right of the last period is edu and the first forward slash. We make the determination that it is \"hawaii.edu\" which is the official web site used by the University of Hawai‘i.\n    \n     \n    \n\nOther Resources\n\n    Information Security at UH\n    SEAR the Phish\n    Mobile Device Security"

    "title": "Virtual Server: How to install and configure backups (Bacula Enterprise) on a Windows Server",
    "content": "SUMMARY:\nThe Bacula backup service is the optional daily backup service listed in the ITS VMware Hosted Solutions page. Backups are FILE LEVEL only.\nIf you are a VM customer and have purchased this service, a client will need to be configured on your server to communicate with the backup server. This article describes installing and configuring the Bacula client on a Windows Server VM.\nPREREQUISITES\nYou should already have this service purchased through ITS Managed Services. A staff member will provide information to the private network for the backups:\n\nPrivate network IP address\nPrivate network gateway address\nPrivate network subnet mask\n\nAn additional network interface (NIC) for the private network will also be added on the VM and an installation file for the Bacula Enterprise client will be sent to you (via UH Filedrop).\nPLEASE NOTE: Some virtual servers were not configured to have two networks. If your server has only one network, please follow these instructions.\nDETAILS:\nPart I: Configuring the private network and adding static routes\nPart II: Configuring the backup client\nPart I: Configuring the private network and adding static routes\n\n    Confirm that you have a secondary network interface added on your VM. This can be viewed in the Network Connections window, or by going to Start > Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings.\n    \n    \n    \n    To easily differentiate between the two interfaces, you can rename your primary interface to something like \"Public\" and \"Backup-private\" for the secondary interface. The public network interface has the public facing IP configured for the VM.\n     \n    Right-click on the secondary (private) interface and go to Properties. Uncheck \"Internet Protocal Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)\" and select \"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\" and click Properties.\n    \n    \n     \n    Select \"Use the following IP address\" in the window that opens and fill out the network information.\n    \n    Below is an example of what the configuration will look like. The IP address in the screenshot is just an example; your actual private IP address will be provided by staff.\n    \n    \n    \n    IP address: provided by ITS staff\n    Subnet mask: provided by ITS staff\n    Default gateway: left BLANK\n    \n    Preferred DNS server: 192.168.10.115\n    Alternate DNS server: 192.168.10.116\n    \n    Click OK to confirm the settings and save.\n     \n     Next, static routes will need to be configured on the private network interface. Open the Command Prompt and run as an admistrator and enter \n    \n    netstat -r \n    \n    to display the routing table (the window will need to be expanded to show the entire output).\n    \n    Take note of the Interface List in the output as you will need to note down the interface number. In this example, the interface number of the secondard private interface is \"16\" (outlined in red below). You should also double-check the MAC address to make sure it is correct.\n    \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    Run the following commands in the terminal to add the static routes. You will need to know your private gateway IP address as provided by Managed Services staff.\n    \n    route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number>\n    route add 172.16.0.0 mask 255.240.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number>\n    route add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number>\n    \n     \n    \n    The screenshot example shows adding the three static routes to the private gateway IP address 172.17.36.1 to the secondary network interface, which Windows defined as 16.\n    \n    \n    Enter netstat -r again in the command prompt to confirm the addition of the static routes.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    To test that the routes are properly configured, run the nslookup command on these two hosts to verify it resolves to those IPs. This ensures that the server is able to see the two Bacula backup servers.\n    \n    dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 172.24.100.11\n    dr-sto12.pvt.hawaii.edu 172.24.100.12\n    \n    NOTE: On Windows Server 2016, the nslookup command may not properly resolve the Bacula hosts unless you specify the private DNS server, i.e.\n    \n    nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 192.168.10.115\n    \n    \n    Update the Windows Firewall to allow incoming traffic on ports 9102 and 9103 from dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu (172.24.100.11) and dr-sto12.pvt.hawaii.edu (172.24.100.12).\n    \n        \n        Reference on configuring Windows Firewall: https://www.rootusers.com/configure-windows-firewall-advanced-security/\n        \n         \n        \n    \n    \n\nSingle-Network Servers\nYour  virtual server may not have been configured with two networks. If you  have a single public network assigned on your server, you do not need to  setup static routing.\nPlease be sure to change the DNS addresses on the public network interface to the following:\n192.168.10.115\n192.168.10.116\nThen, run nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 192.168.10.115 to verify that the Bacula server host can be resolved. After that, you may follow the instructions to install the Bacula client.\n \nPart II: Configuring the backup client\n\n     Install the Bacula Enterprise 8.6.16 client (bacula-enterprise-win64-8.6.16.exe) by right-clicking the file and selecting “Run as Administrator”.\n    \n    Click Next at the below dialog box.\n    \n    \n    If you agree to the license agreement, click I Agree at the below dialog box.\n    \n    \n    Choose Automatic at the below dialog box and then click Next.\n    \n    \n    When the dialog box below appears, select the items below and uncheck the others.\n    \n    Client\n    Plugins\n    - Place a checkmark next to “alldrives Plugin”\n    - Place a checkmark next to “winbmr Plugin”\n    - Uncheck “Old (deprecated) Exchange Plugin”\n    \n    Enter the following value into the DIR Name field.\n    \n    DIR Name:  bacula-dir\n    \n    Leave the “Save Client template in” checkbox UNCHECKED.\n    \n    \n    Click Finish at the below dialog box.  It’s probably a good idea to read the Readme file.\n    \n     \n     Open Notepad as an Administrator (right-click it and go to \"Run as Administrator). Open C:\\Programs Files\\Bacula\\bacula-fd.conf. \n    \n    In the below section, remove the “-fd” from the shortname of the  host (for example, hostname-fd to hostname).  Also, change Maximum Concurrent Jobs to  20.\n    FileDaemon {                            # this is me\n       Name = hostname\n       FDport = 9102                # where we listen for the director\n       WorkingDirectory = \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bacula\\\\working\"\n       Pid Directory = \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bacula\\\\working\"\n       Plugin Directory = \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bacula\\\\plugins\"\n       Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20\n    }\n    \n    DELETE the below section:\n    #\n     # Restricted Director, used by tray-monitor to get the\n     #   status of the file daemon\n     #\n     Director {\n       Name = hostname-mon\n       Password =\"some-password\"\n       Monitor = yes \n     }\n    \n    In the \"some-password\" field, copy this password and save it in a separate text file. You will need to file drop this to us so that it can be configured on our end.\n    # \n    # List Directors who are permitted to contact this File daemon\n    #\n    Director {\n       Name = bacula-dir\n       Password = \"some-password\"        # Director must know this password\n    }\n     \n    Save your changes to the bacula-fd.conf file and close it. You may want to re-open it again just to ensure changed have been saved. \n    Go to Administrative Tools > Services and restart the Bacula File Backup Service. Search for Bacula File Backup Service right click, and select Restart. \n    \n    \n    \n    The process should start with no errors. If you get an error or if the process hangs, review the previous steps to ensure Bacula was installed and configured correctly.\n     \n    The Bacula installation and setup process is now complete. Email itscs@hawaii.edu to let us know that the client has been configured. A staff member will respond and ask you to send the password (via UH Filedrop) that you saved earlier so we can start the backups.\n     \n\n \nRELATED ARTICLES:\nData Center Services\nVirtual Hosting: How to Submit a Restore Request\nVirtual Server: File Level Backup Policy\nVirtual Server: How to install and configure backups (Bacula) on a Red Hat Linux Server"

VSS allows for files to be backed up when in use.\n     \n    Linux does not have VSS, so files should be closed prior to the backup window to ensure they are backed up.\n     \n    Bacula will not backup databases live.  If you are running a database server, you will either need to stop or pause your database services during the backup window, or export your database and store the copy in a location that's being backed up.\n     \n    Please refer to the Virtual Hosting SLA on retention period for your backup. Backups that are beyond this retention period are automatically expired.

The backup times vary based on load and amount of data to backup, so we cannot guarantee a specific backup time. \n\nUpon request, we can initiate one test restore per year to ensure the integrity of the backups.  Customers do not have direct access to the backups, and restore requests are initiated through ITS Managed Services (itscs@hawaii.edu).  At this time, there are no additional fees to request a restore, pending availability.\nTo request a backup, we will need the following information:\n\n    The name of your virtual server hosted by ITS Managed Services\n    Which directories need to be backed up\n    An estimate of how much storage space the backup will require\n\n If there are any questions, please email itscs@hawaii.edu.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLES: \n\n    Data Center Services\n    Virtual Server: How to install and configure backups (Bacula) on a Windows Server\n    Virtual Server: How to Install and Configure Backups (Bacula) on a RHEL Server\n    Virtual Hosting: How to Submit a Restore Request"

    "content": "SUMMARY\nThe Bacula Enterprise Edition (BEE) backup service is the optional daily backup service listed in the ITS VMware Hosted Solutions page. Backups are file level only.\nIf you are a virtual server customer and have purchased the daily backup service, a BEE client  will need to be configured on your server to communicate with the backup  server. This article describes installing and configuring the BEE client on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual server.\nPREREQUISITES\n\n    You should already have the daily backup service purchased through ITS Managed Services. If you have not already done so, please contact ITS Managed Services at itscs@hawaii.edu to do so.\n     \n    You should already have a private network connection on your virtual server. For more information, please see Virtual Server: How to Connect Your ITS-Hosted RHEL 7 Virtual Server to an ITS Private Network.\n\nPROCEDURE\nDo the following to install a BEE client on your RHEL virtual server:\n\n    Contact ITS Managed Services at itscs@hawaii.edu asking that the latest version of the BEE client .rpm packages be file dropped to you (via the UH Filedrop service). Once you have these files, upload them to your virtual server's /root directory.\n\n\n    Log into your virtual server and switch user to the root user.\n     \n    Install the BEE client software:\n\n# cd /root\n# yum install -y ./bacula-enterprise-*.rpm\n\n\nNOTE: You may need to install the bacula-enterprise-lib-*.rpm file first before installing the bacula-enterprise-client-*.rpm file.\n\n    Modify the /opt/bacula/etc/bacula-fd.conf file (installed when you install the BEE client) as outlined in the following example. In this example, \"bac10\" is used as the hostname, but for your server, it should be the short hostname of your virtual server.\n\n(a) Change this:\nDirector {\n  Name = bac10-dir\n  Password = \"< random_password_1 >\"\n}\nTo this (change the Name and use the randomly generated password, or create your own):\nDirector {\n  Name = bacula-dir\n  Password = \"<random-password>\"\n}\n \n(b) Change this:\nDirector {\n  Name = bac10-mon\n  Password = \"a long random password\"\n  Monitor = yes\n} \nTo this (comment out all lines by prefixing them with a \"#\"):\n#Director {\n#  Name = bacula-dir-mon\n#  Password = \"a long random password\"\n#  Monitor = yes\n#}\n  \n(c) Change this:\nFileDaemon {                          # this is me\n  Name = bac10-fd\n  FDport = 9102                  # where we listen for the director\n  WorkingDirectory = /opt/bacula/working\n  Pid Directory = /opt/bacula/working\n  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20\n  Plugin Directory = /opt/bacula/plugins\n} \nTo this (remove \"-fd\" from shortname of the host.  Change Maximum Concurrent Jobs to 20):\nFileDaemon {                          # this is me\n  Name = bac10\n  FDport = 9102                  # where we listen for the director\n  WorkingDirectory = /opt/bacula/working\n  Pid Directory = /opt/bacula/working\n  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20\n  Plugin Directory = /opt/bacula/plugins\n}\n \n(d) Change this:\nMessages {\n  Name = Standard\n  director = bac10-dir = all, !skipped, !restored, !saved\n}\nTo this (change director name):\nMessages {\n  Name = Standard\n  director = bacula-dir = all, !skipped, !restored, !saved\n}\n\n    Enable automatic start of the BEE client upon server boot:\n    \n\nRHEL 7 and 8: # systemctl enable bacula-fd\n\n    Restart bacula-fd service:\n    \n\nRHEL 7 and 8: # systemctl start bacula-fd\n\n    Run the following command to allow port 9102 incoming for the backup traffic:\n    \n    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=9102/tcp && firewall-cmd --reload.\n     \n\n\n    (Optional) If TCP Wrappers is configured in the OS, add a rule to allow incoming connections from the Bacula Director Server dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu. E.g., modify the /etc/hosts.allow file to add the line \"ALL: 172.24.100.11 dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu\").\n\n\n    (Optional) Delete the bacula-enterprise-* .rpm files from /root.\n     \n    Notify IT TI-Applications that you have completed installing the BEE client on your virtual server. Please let us know the name of your virtual server, which directories you want backed up, and an estimate of you much storage space you expect the backup to require. Do not include the Bacula password in this email. If it is emailed in clear text, you will be required to change the password. A staff member from Contract Services will respond to you and ask you to send the password you made note of in step 4b above via the UH Filedrop service.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n    Data Center Services\n    Virtual Hosting: How to Submit a Restore Request\n    Virtual Server: File Level Backup Policy\n    Virtual Server: How to install and configure backups (Bacula) on a Windows Server                          \n    Virtual Server: How to Connect Your ITS-Hosted RHEL 6 Virtual Server to an ITS Private Network\n    Virtual Server: How to Connect Your ITS-Hosted RHEL 7 Virtual Server to an ITS Private Network"

    "title": "Virtual Server: How to Connect Your ITS-Hosted RHEL 7 Virtual Server to an ITS Private Network",
    "content": "OVERVIEW\n\nSometimes in order to access certain services offered by UH Information Technology Services (ITS) from your ITS-hosted virtual server, you will need to have access to an ITS private network. The instructions in this article give you instructions on how to make sure your virtual server is connected to an ITS private network.\n \nThese instructions only apply to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 virtual servers created by ITS Managed Services for your use, and only to RHEL systems that have the Network Manager service removed or turned off (e.g., “systemctl networkmanager stop” and “systemctl networkmanager disable”; also see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7-Beta/html/Networking_Guide/sec-NetworkManager_and_the_Network_Scripts.html).\n \nThese instructions are for RHEL 7 environments where the network configuration files are manually maintained, which is the standard configuration for RHEL 6 virtual servers created by ITS Managed Services. You can still use Network Manager if you like, but ITS does not provide instructions for adding a private network connection when Network Manager is enabled so you will have to determine the appropriate procedure yourself.\n \n\nPROCEDURE \nNOTE: All the commands given in the steps below are assumed to be issued as either user root or via \"sudo\".\n\n\n    Enter the command:\n\nifconfig\n \nto see all installed and connected NICs on your virtual server, and make note of the interface/NIC names of the NICs that are installed (e.g., “eno16780032”, “ens224” ,etc.). You may want to send the output of the “ifconfig” command to a text file for later reference—e.g., “ifconfig > ifconfig_results_2017-07-06.txt”.\n\nFor example:\n\n# ifconfig\n\neno16780032: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\n        inet 166.122.3.161  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 166.122.3.255\n        inet6 fe80::250:56ff:feb0:2ddd  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>\n        ether 00:50:56:b0:2d:dd  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)\n        RX packets 1185  bytes 102807 (100.3 KiB)\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\n        TX packets 198  bytes 23317 (22.7 KiB)\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\n\n\nens224: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\n        inet 172.17.36.14  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 172.17.36.255\n        inet6 fe80::250:56ff:feb0:5673  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>\n        ether 00:50:56:b0:56:73  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)\n        RX packets 689  bytes 146959 (143.5 KiB)\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\n        TX packets 688  bytes 89245 (87.1 KiB)\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\n\n\nlo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536\n        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0\n        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>\n        loop  txqueuelen 1  (Local Loopback)\n        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\n        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\n\n\n \n\n    In the output of the \"ifconfig\" command, look at the “inet” setting for each NIC (if there is one) and see if any have a value other than 128.171.*.* (e.g., 128.171.38.164) or 166.122.3.* (e.g., 166.122.3.3) or 127.0.0.1 (the standard internal loopback interface). Any value other than those subnets indicate the NIC does have a private network IP associated with it. If no \"inet addr\" setting is listed for a NIC, it means that the NIC is connected but has not been configured with an IPv4 IP address yet, and ITS CS will need to verify if the NIC is connected to a private network or not (step 4 below).\n     \n    If a NIC on your virtual server does have a private network IP associated with it, please skip to step 17 below (verify DNS resolves .pvt and .mgt). Otherwise, continue with the next step below.\n\n\n    Contact ITS Managed Services (itscs@hawaii.edu) and ask that your virtual server be assigned to and connected to an ITS private network. As part of your request, please provide the following info:\n\n* The reason you want to add an ITS private network connection to your virtual server\n\n* Your virtual server’s fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (e.g., leeddash.its.hawaii.edu)\n\n* Your virtual server’s public network IP address (128.171.x.x or 166.122.3.x)\n \n\n    ITS Managed Services will verify that your virtual server does not have a connection to an ITS private network, and if so they will assign your virtual server an IP within an ITS private network, attach a new NIC on your virtual server that connects to that network, and provide you with the private network IP, gateway, and subnet mask information.\n     \n    Once you have the private network IP, gateway, and subnet mask information from ITS CS, do an “ifconfig” command and make note of the newly added NIC’s name (e.g., “ens224”), as well as the NIC name of the existing primary NIC for the public network (e.g., “eno16780032”).\n     \n    Back up the existing /etc/sysconfig/network file (e.g., “cp /etc/sysconfig/network /etc/sysconfig/network.2017-07-06”) and then edit the /etc/sysconfig/network file and ensure it contains only the following lines (substitute the bracketed items with appropriate values):\n\n \nNETWORKING=yes\nHOSTNAME=<Host-FQDN>\nGATEWAY=<Gateway-IP-For-Primary-NIC-Public-Network>\nGATEWAYDEV=<Primary-NIC-Name>\n \nFor example:\n \nNETWORKING=yes\nHOSTNAME=cstemplate06.its.hawaii.edu\nGATEWAY=166.122.3.1\nGATEWAYDEV=eno16780032\n \n\n    Create a /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<NIC-name> file (where <NIC-name> is the name of the new NIC as determined in step 6; e.g., /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens224). You can do so with “vi” or \"nano\" any basic text editor of your choice (or perhaps just copying the primary non-private NIC’s config file and just editing it—e.g., “cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno16780032 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens224”).\n     \n    Edit the new ifcfg-<NIC-name> file created in the previous step so that it contains the following minimal entries:\n\n \nDEVICE=“<NIC-name>”\nBOOTPROTO=static\nONBOOT=yes\nUSERCTL=no\nIPADDR=<Assigned-Private-Network-IP>\nNETMASK=<Assigned-Private-Network-Subnet-Mask>\nPEERDNS=no\n \nFor example:\n \nDEVICE=\"ens224\"\nBOOTPROTO=static\nONBOOT=yes\nUSERCTL=no\nIPADDR=172.17.36.14\nNETMASK=255.255.255.0\nPEERDNS=no\n \n \n\n    Create and edit a new /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-<NIC-name> file (where <NIC-name> is the name of the new NIC; e.g., /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-ens224) that contains the following lines:\n\n \n192.168.0.0/16 via <Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP> dev <NIC-name>\n172.16.0.0/12 via <Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP> dev <NIC-name>\n10.0.0.0/8 via <Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP> dev <NIC-name>\n \nFor example:\n \n192.168.0.0/16 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1\n172.16.0.0/12 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1\n10.0.0.0/8 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1\n \n\n    Schedule a reboot the virtual server to incorporate all the changes you’ve made so far (just restarting the network service doesn't seem to be enough). E.g., when ready, as user root, enter the following command to reboot:\n\nreboot\n \n\n    Log back into the server and switch user to the \"root\" user (if you cannot access the server after rebooting, you may need to log in via the virtual console to troubleshoot if you have access [see Virtual Server: How to Access Your Virtual Server via VMware Console Access] or contact ITS CS at itscs@hawaii.edu to help you); one there, print out the current network routing table using the command:\n\n ip route show\n \n\n    Examine the results of the “ip route show” command and ensure that among the entries shown are ones similar to those given in step 10 above and also a “default” entry that specifies the primary (public) NIC’s gateway and NIC name. E.g.:\n\n \n# ip route show\n166.122.3.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 166.122.3.160 \n172.17.65.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 172.17.65.11 \n169.254.0.0/16 dev eth0  scope link  metric 1002 \n169.254.0.0/16 dev eth1  scope link  metric 1003 \n192.168.0.0/16 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 \n172.16.0.0/12 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 \n10.0.0.0/8 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 \ndefault via 166.122.3.1 dev eth0 \n \n \n\n    Verify that you can ping google.com okay:\n\n \n# ping google.com\nPING google.com (216.58.193.78) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=66.7 ms\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=65.5 ms\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=65.6 ms\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=4 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=5 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=6 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms\n^C\n--- google.com ping statistics ---\n6 packets transmitted, 6 received, 0% packet loss, time 5645ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 65.535/65.862/66.790/0.470 ms\n \n \n\n    Back up the existing /etc/resolv.conf file (e.g., “cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.2017-07-06”) and then edit the /etc/resolv.conf file and ensure it consists of only the following three lines:\n\nsearch hawaii.edu its.hawaii.edu pvt.hawaii.edu mgt.hawaii.edu colo.hawaii.edu\nnameserver 192.168.10.115\nnameserver 192.168.10.116\n \n\n    Once again, verify that you can ping google.com okay (this verifies that you can reach the private DNS servers specified in the previous step; if the ping doesn't work, then back out by restoring the original contents of your /etc/resolv.conf file so that you have DNS resolution again, and then troubleshoot):\n\n \n# ping google.com\nPING google.com (216.58.193.78) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=66.7 ms\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=65.5 ms\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=65.6 ms\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=4 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=5 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms\n64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=6 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms\n^C\n--- google.com ping statistics ---\n6 packets transmitted, 6 received, 0% packet loss, time 5645ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 65.535/65.862/66.790/0.470 ms\n \n\n    Verify that you can resolve a .pvt hostname via DNS okay.

As long as your mobile device has mobile network or wi-fi service, authentication requests can be pushed to your device via the Duo Mobile app.  You can download the Duo Mobile app to an iOS or Android device that meets the minimum requirements.\n\n    \n        \n            iOS\n            Please see https://guide.duo.com/iphone for the supported version of iOS\n        \n        \n            Android\n            Please see https://guide.duo.com/android for the supported version of Android\n        \n    \n\nOnce you have downloaded the Duo Mobile app and registered your mobile device, authentication requests will be \"pushed\" to your device through the Duo Mobile app.  You would then open the Duo Mobile app and tap on \"Approve\" or \"Deny\" to approve or deny the authentication request.\nDuo Passcode via the Duo Mobile App\nThe Duo Mobile app can be used to generate a passcode that can be used to login. Passcodes can be generated without requiring internet access, and can be used even if your mobile device is in airplane mode or otherwise not connected to a WiFi or mobile network with internet access. This is a great option to use when traveling or when in areas where access to the internet might not be guaranteed.\nPhone Call\nYou can opt to authenticate via a phone call to a landline or mobile phone.  When it's time to authenticate, you will receive a call on your registered phone number.  You would then push \"1\" on your phone's keypad to authenticate, or push \"9\" to deny the authentication request.\nRegarding phone numbers beginning with \"+86\"\nITS has been informed by Duo that due to recent telephony restrictions by the Chinese government, Duo is no longer able to authenticate by phone calls to users with +86 numbers.  If you have a +86 phone number registered in Duo, you will see the following notice:\n \nOther methods, such as Duo Push, SMS passcodes, or hard tokens will still work.  For more information, please refer to the following Duo knowledgebase article:\nhttps://help.duo.com/s/article/5001\nSMS Passcodes\nIf you do not have a smartphone, but you have a mobile phone with SMS/text messaging capabilities, you can use SMS passcodes to authenticate. When requested, a set of 10 passcodes will be sent to you as a text (SMS) message to your phone.  Each time you authenticate, you would use the next passcode in the sequence. After you've used all 10 passcodes, you can request a new set of 10 passcodes. You can also request a new set of 10 passcodes at any time. After you've requested a set of 10 passcodes, you can continue to use all of the passcodes in succession to authenticate even if your mobile device is no longer connected to mobile network.\nYubikey Hard Token\nA hard token (sometimes called an authentication or security token) is a hardware security device that is used to authorize a user.  UH provides Yubikey hard tokens for purchase.  The UH hard token is a usb device and must be inserted into your usb port to be used.  You would then touch the hard token anytime you wanted to authenticate.  If you do not have an available usb port, you cannot authenticate with the UH hard token. Hard tokens are not recommended and should be purchased only if you cannot use any of the other above means for authenticating.\nFor information on purchasing a UH hard token, please visit https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/\n\n\n\nStep 2: Decide which two devices you want to use\nITS strongly recommends that you setup at least two devices for MFA.  This is so that if one of your devices becomes unavailable (e.g smartphone forgotten or lost), you can still authenticate.  Some samples of multiple devices could be:\n\n    Smartphone and office landline\n    Smartphone, office landline, and home landline\n\nOnce you have decided which two (or more) devices you will use for MFA, proceed to the next step (Step 3) of setting up your first device.  If you have already setup one device, you may proceed to step 4 to add more devices.\n\nStep 3: Setup your first device\n\n\n\n\tUH Login Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Getting started with your first device\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    Setting up a Smartphone\n    Setting up a Landline\n    Setting up a non-Smartphone Cellular Phone\n    Setting up a Tablet\n\nFor more information about UH Login and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), go to www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin.\nBefore going through this article, please review UH Login Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Which authentication method should I use? to determine which authentication method suits your situation best.  Once you have decided which method to use, use this document to register your first device.  This document will explain how to register a mobile device, landline, or tablet as your first device to use for MFA.\nWe strongly recommend registering at least 2 devices.  For example: a smartphone and an office landline.  Please refer to UH Login Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Managing Devices for information on managing registered devices, or UH Login Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Adding Devices for information on registering additional devices.\nSetting up a Smartphone\nAlthough the screenshots and instructions that follow are for an iPhone, the steps are the same for iPhones and Android phones, except for identifying the type of smartphone.\nWatch video\n\n    Login to the UH Login MFA Device Registration site at www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin/device-reg.\n    \n    You will see the following screen.

    "content": "After scanning a device and Spirion finds potential matches for sensitive or private data, you are given the ability to perform four actions: Shred, Redact, Encrypt, and Quarantine. Below is an explanation of what each action does.\nShred\nChoosing Shred will delete the entire file found to have sensitive data using the U.S. Department of Defense deletion standard, known as DOD 5220.22-M. Shredded files CANNOT be recovered.\nShred works on all file types.\nRedact\nChoosing Redact will attempt to replace the highlighted data from the Preview Pane with a string of x characters. This will keep all other data in the file intact.\nRedact has been tested to work on .txt, .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, and .csv files.\nEncrypt\nChoosing Encrypt will attempt to encrypt the file using its associated application first. For example, if the file is a PDF, Spirion will attempt to encrypt the file using the PDF standard. The entire file will be encrypted, leaving the data unreadable until decrypted. If successful, your Spirion Profile password is required to unlock and view the file. The file will remain encrypted after each viewing.\nIf that fails, Spirion will store the selected file in a \"Spirion Vault File\", which requires the user's profile password to decrypt. The Entire file will be encrypted, leaving the data unreadable until decrypted. Performing an decryption does so permanently, not temporarily. You will need to encrypt the file again manually after each decryption.\nEncrypt works on all file types.\nQuarantine\nChoosing Quarantine will move the file to a \"quarantined location\" and shred it from its original location. You will be asked to select the quarantine location in a pop-up menu.\nNote: This will NOT shred, redact, or encrypt the data in any way. This just moves the data to another location. The sensitive data will still be accessible in the file.\nQuarantine works on all file types."

For the full instructions on installing and configuring Bacula Enterprise, see the instructions here.\nStatic routes are required when multiple network adapters are configured, so that only one network gateway is allowed at a time.This article assumes you will be configuring a private network adapter on the ITS private network on a Windows Server. The steps may differ if you're configuring static routes for a non-ITS private network.\nPREREQUISITES\nYou will need (provided by ITS Managed Services):\nPrivate IP address\nPrivate gateway IP address\nPrivate subnet mask\n\nAn additional network interface (NIC) for the private network will also  be added on the VM by Managed Services (MS) staff. You will need to manually input the IP addresses in the network configuration. Follow the screenshot in the example below. Make sure to leave the \"Default gateway\" BLANK. \nUse these DNS servers for the ITS private network:\n192.168.10.115\n192.168.10.116\n\n\n\nNOTE: For non-ITS networks, the DNS servers will be different.\n\n\n    Static routes will need to be configured on the private  network interface. Open the Command Prompt and run as an admistrator and  enter \n    \n    netstat -r \n    \n    to display the routing table (the window will need to be expanded to show the entire output).\n    \n    Take note of the Interface List in the output as  you will need to note down the interface number. In this example, the  interface number of the secondary private interface is \"16\" (outlined in  red below). You should also double-check the MAC address to make sure  it is correct.\n    \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    Run the following commands in the terminal to add the static routes. You will need to know your private gateway IP address as provided by MS staff.\n    \n    route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number>\n    route add 172.16.0.0 mask 255.240.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number>\n    route add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number>\n    \n     \n    \n    The screenshot example shows adding the three static routes to the private gateway IP address 172.17.36.1 to the secondary network interface, which Windows defined as 16.\n    \n    \n    Enter netstat -r again in the command prompt to confirm the addition of the static routes.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    To test that the routes are properly configured, enter \n    \n    nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu\n    \n    to see if the DNS servers will resolve the offsite backup server. If it resolves, the output below will be displayed."

    "content": "Overview\nOn June 12, 1992, Governor Waihe‘e signed a bill relating to the Hawaiian language that essentially authorizes and encourages the use of macrons and glottal stops whenever words or terms in the Hawaiian language are used in documents prepared by or for state or county agencies and officials. Requested for the Hawaiian language faculty by Dr. Emily Hawkins, assistant Professor of Indo-Pacific Languages and drafted by Rep. Brian Taniguchi's office, this Act 169 has been incorporated as an amendment to our University of Hawaii Procedures Business Circular 835. This circular essentially states that all information on letterheads, envelopes and business cards will include the appropriate Hawaiian diacritical marks.

Follow the directions above to add your Hawaiian words to customize your Autocorrect dictionary.\n\n\nUsing Autocorrect in Google Docs\nIn your Google doc, simply type the Hawaiian word without the diacritic symbols. The word will be auto-corrected with the proper Hawaiian diacritics."

The default setting is Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)which means the update is ready for most people.  You can change this setting to Semi-Annual Channel which defers feature updates until Microsoft declares them \"ready for widespread use in organizations.\"\n    Option 2 allows you to specify additional time after the official release to the channel you selected. You can delay the upgrade by up to an additional 365 days from its initial release date.\n    Option 3 works independently of the feature update settings and allows you to defer the monthly cumulative security updates and any additional out-of-band updates by up to 30 days."

Previously, ITS was absorbing the costs, but regrettably now needs to pass on the costs. Fee is set at $10 per UH Username per academic semester (or equivalent time period). For additional questions, please call the ITS Help Desk, (808) 956-8883 on Oahu or toll free (800) 558-2669 from neighbor islands, and ask to escalate to a staff member.\n\n\nUsername Rules and Guidelines\nUH Usernames are used for many University of Hawai'i services including UH Email. This should be kept in mind when creating the account. The following are rules that constitute a valid UH Username including Departmental and Registered Independent Organizational (RIO) accounts:\n\n    A UH Username will be at least 2 characters and at most 8 characters in length, with at least 2 letter characters.\n    A UH Username will only consist of number and letter characters, and no special characters.\n    A UH Username will start with a letter character.\n    A UH Username will not have the numbers 1, 5, or 0 after letter characters to prevent mistaking those numbers for the letters L, S, or O.\nA UH Username will not have numbers between letter characters.\n\nThe rules above are in place for all UH Usernames and must be adhered to. The following rules listed are primarily in place for individual accounts:\n\n    A UH Username will be based on the user's legal name as it appears in the University of Hawai'i record.\n    A UH Username will not contain sensitive personal information including the social security number, or date of birth in part or in whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tUH Account Management and Changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYou must activate your UH account before you can use your UH Email (Note: This was called an UH Email Account previous to September 2004). After your UH account is activated, your email address is your UH username with @hawaii.edu (e.g. the username “johns” would have the email address johns@hawaii.edu). Your UH email account is used for important campus information and should be checked periodically.\nFor specific instructions on activating or managing your UH Account, like reseting your password or changing your account's security questions, please select your role at the University:\n\n    Student\n    Staff/Faculty\n    University of Hawai’i Affiliate \n    University of Hawai’i ‘Ohana (Alumni and Former Faculty)\n\nNote: Departmental and Organizational (RIO) usernames, that is, usernames that are used on behalf of departments or organizations, are handled separately from individual accounts. To manage or request a Departmental or Organizational username, please visit www.hawaii.edu/its/id.\nChanges to Your UH Username\nUH usernames are based on your legal name or preferred name as it appears on official UH records. Active faculty, staff, or students can request a username change under the following circumstances:\n\n    There is a misspelling in your name which also appears in your UH Username\n    Your legal name or preferred name has changed and your UH Username no longer reflects your legal or preferred name\n\nNote: Your legal name or preferred name must be changed/updated at the appropriate UH office before requesting the username change. If your name has not yet been updated in official UH records, ITS will not process the username change request.\n\n    Students: Please check with your campus' Admissions and Records office for proper procedures and documentation to make a name change on your student records.\n    Faculty & Staff: Please check with your personnel officer to make a name change in PeopleSoft.\n\nIf one of these situations apply to you, contact the ITS Help Desk with your request to change your UH Username.  You will be asked to verify your identity and provide a legitimate reason for the username change (e.g., marriage, divorce, legal name change, preferred name change, etc.).\nFor more information on UH's Preferred Name Policy, please visit https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ep&policyChapter=7&policyNumber=302.\nInstructions for Requesting a UH Username Change\nBy Phone\nPlease call the ITS Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 or toll-free from neighbor islands (800) 558-2669 and inquire about changing your username.\nBy Email\nEmail the ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu and inquire about changing your username.\nAfter you have made the request to change your UH Username, ITS will email you to confirm the request for a UH Username change.  Once you have received this confirmation email, you must send a reply back to ITS.  This reply will confirm that you want to change your UH Username.  After ITS has received the reply from you, your UH Username will be changed to the new UH Username and the account should be available in one to two business days.  Your password is moved to your new account. It does not change.\nYou may also request that mail sent to your old email address be delivered to your new email address.  This gives you time to notify correspondents of the change in your UH Username and unsubscribe from mailing lists.  If you request this option, the following will occur:\n\n    The old account is disabled and made inaccessible by ITS.\n    ITS moves all files associated with the old account over to the new account.\n    The old account is configured by ITS such that email to the old account automatically goes to the new account for up to 30-days.\n\nNote: you will be responsible for notifying your contacts of your email address change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tUH Account Closure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    Students, Non-retiring Faculty/Staff, and UH Affiliates\n    Retiring Faculty/Staff, and Emeriti\n    Deceased Student or Employee/Affiliate\n    UH Account Termination\n\n\nStudent, Non-retiring Faculty/Staff, and UH Affiliate\nStudents who are not registered for classes for consecutive (Fall, Spring) semesters, Faculty and Staff who leave UH, but are not retiring, and UH Affiliates whose affiliations expire, transition to the role of 'Ohana. 'Ohana will have a grace period of up to 180 days, during which they will continue to have full access to basic online services, unless there is a request to terminate the UH Email Account sooner, or because of violations to the acceptable use policy (https://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/policies/itpolicy.html). ITS will inform each individual via email when they begin the grace period and ITS will send periodic reminders throughout the grace period to help keep them aware of the approach of the end of the grace period. During the grace period, they will have the option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services, which will keep the individual's UH email account active and available.\nAfter the grace period ends, if an individual has enrolled in our 'Ohana online services, their UH email account, along with all email messages and folders stored in the account, will continue to be available contingent on annual renewal of this enrollment. The UH email account, and all email messages and documents stored in the account, will be no longer be available should an individual fail to enroll in 'Ohana online services prior to the end of the grace period.\n\n\nRetiring Faculty/Staff, and Emeriti\nFaculty and Staff who retire from UH, as well as Emeriti, are allowed continued use of their UH Email Account. Use of the UH Email Account is subject to an annual renewal. Email reminders will be sent to Retirees and Emeriti regarding their respective upcoming renewal deadline. For more details about basic online services for Retirees and Emeriti, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/933.\n\n\nDeceased Student or Employee/Affiliate\nStudent\nIn the unfortunate event that a UH student should pass away, the following procedure will be used by ITS:\n\n    \n    The appropriate Dean of Student Services notifies the ITS Help Desk of the event. The following information is required so that the ITS Help Desk can create an auto-reply message.\n    \n        UH Username or UH Number of the deceased\n        Name of the deceased\n    \n    \n    \n    ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean) is:\n    This is an automated message:\n    This email is no longer available.\n    \n    ITS clears the password.\n    On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted.\n\nEmployee/Affiliate\nIn the unfortunate event that an employee or UH affiliated person should pass away, the following procedure will be used by ITS:\n\n    \n    Dean/Director notifies ITS of the event and ITS will change the account’s password. The following information is required so that ITS can create an auto-reply message and to ensure that no new email is accepted\n    \n        Name of the deceased\n        Responsible party in the unit to whom external correspondents can be referred, typically the manager, department chair, dean, director, etc. For this individual, we require their name, title, and email address.\n    \n    \n    Dean/Director notifies ITS of the email agent who will be responsible for reviewing the email of the deceased to ensure that no official business is outstanding. The email agent would be the person entrusted to go through the desk of the deceased to separate personal items from UH business materials.\n    \n    ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean/Director) is:\n    This is an automated message.\n    First name Last name is no longer working at the University of Hawaii.\n    You may contact Responsible-First name Responsible-Last name, Responsible-Title, at responsible-email-address.\n    \n    ITS clears password and forwards it to the email agent\n    The email agent identified reviews all old emails to identify any unread messages that require official action/response. These are either replied to or forwarded as appropriate based on context. Upon completion of the review and handling, the email agent can either delete all messages or ask ITS to do so.\n    On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted.\n\n\n\nAccount Termination\nUniversity unit authorities (e.g. Vice Presidents, Chancellors, Vice Chancellors, Deans, Directors, Department Head, Administrative Officers, etc.) can request a UH Account termination for a faculty, staff, or affiliate under their purview by making a formal request on departmental letterhead. The signature of the University unit authority (or their designee) is required. When the termination is requested, it is possible that the individual using the UH Account has established additional affiliations with UH, such as becoming a student or becoming a faculty or staff with another UH unit. ITS will research all termination requests in order to ascertain if there are additional affiliations by the individual. If there are no other affiliations, the UH Email Account will be flagged for termination. By default, the UH Account will remain open for 180 days. If access to the UH Account must be immediately cut-off, the letter must explicitly request this.\nRequests should be sent via File Drop to the ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tUH Account Privacy Policy\n\n\n\n\tUnder normal circumstances, email is considered private and is not subject to audit or review except as stated in UH Executive Policy E2.210: “Use and Management of Information Technology Resources”. UH Systemwide Policies and Procedures Information can be found by visiting www.hawaii.edu/policy."

Previously, ITS was absorbing the costs, but regrettably now needs to pass on the costs. Fee is set at $10 per UH Username per academic semester (or equivalent time period). For additional questions, please call the ITS Help Desk, (808) 956-8883 on Oahu or toll free (800) 558-2669 from neighbor islands, and ask to escalate to a staff member.\n\n\nUsername Rules and Guidelines\nUH Usernames are used for many University of Hawai'i services including UH Email. This should be kept in mind when creating the account. The following are rules that constitute a valid UH Username including Departmental and Registered Independent Organizational (RIO) accounts:\n\n    A UH Username will be at least 2 characters and at most 8 characters in length, with at least 2 letter characters.\n    A UH Username will only consist of number and letter characters, and no special characters.\n    A UH Username will start with a letter character.\n    A UH Username will not have the numbers 1, 5, or 0 after letter characters to prevent mistaking those numbers for the letters L, S, or O.\nA UH Username will not have numbers between letter characters.\n\nThe rules above are in place for all UH Usernames and must be adhered to. The following rules listed are primarily in place for individual accounts:\n\n    A UH Username will be based on the user's legal name as it appears in the University of Hawai'i record.\n    A UH Username will not contain sensitive personal information including the social security number, or date of birth in part or in whole."

After your UH account is activated, your email address is your UH username with @hawaii.edu (e.g. the username “johns” would have the email address johns@hawaii.edu). Your UH email account is used for important campus information and should be checked periodically.\nFor specific instructions on activating or managing your UH Account, like reseting your password or changing your account's security questions, please select your role at the University:\n\n    Student\n    Staff/Faculty\n    University of Hawai’i Affiliate \n    University of Hawai’i ‘Ohana (Alumni and Former Faculty)\n\nNote: Departmental and Organizational (RIO) usernames, that is, usernames that are used on behalf of departments or organizations, are handled separately from individual accounts. To manage or request a Departmental or Organizational username, please visit www.hawaii.edu/its/id.\nChanges to Your UH Username\nUH usernames are based on your legal name or preferred name as it appears on official UH records. Active faculty, staff, or students can request a username change under the following circumstances:\n\n    There is a misspelling in your name which also appears in your UH Username\n    Your legal name or preferred name has changed and your UH Username no longer reflects your legal or preferred name\n\nNote: Your legal name or preferred name must be changed/updated at the appropriate UH office before requesting the username change. If your name has not yet been updated in official UH records, ITS will not process the username change request.\n\n    Students: Please check with your campus' Admissions and Records office for proper procedures and documentation to make a name change on your student records.\n    Faculty & Staff: Please check with your personnel officer to make a name change in PeopleSoft.\n\nIf one of these situations apply to you, contact the ITS Help Desk with your request to change your UH Username.  You will be asked to verify your identity and provide a legitimate reason for the username change (e.g., marriage, divorce, legal name change, preferred name change, etc.).\nFor more information on UH's Preferred Name Policy, please visit https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ep&policyChapter=7&policyNumber=302.\nInstructions for Requesting a UH Username Change\nBy Phone\nPlease call the ITS Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 or toll-free from neighbor islands (800) 558-2669 and inquire about changing your username.\nBy Email\nEmail the ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu and inquire about changing your username.\nAfter you have made the request to change your UH Username, ITS will email you to confirm the request for a UH Username change.  Once you have received this confirmation email, you must send a reply back to ITS.  This reply will confirm that you want to change your UH Username.  After ITS has received the reply from you, your UH Username will be changed to the new UH Username and the account should be available in one to two business days.  Your password is moved to your new account. It does not change.\nYou may also request that mail sent to your old email address be delivered to your new email address.  This gives you time to notify correspondents of the change in your UH Username and unsubscribe from mailing lists.  If you request this option, the following will occur:\n\n    The old account is disabled and made inaccessible by ITS.\n    ITS moves all files associated with the old account over to the new account.\n    The old account is configured by ITS such that email to the old account automatically goes to the new account for up to 30-days.\n\nNote: you will be responsible for notifying your contacts of your email address change."

'Ohana will have a grace period of up to 180 days, during which they will continue to have full access to basic online services, unless there is a request to terminate the UH Email Account sooner, or because of violations to the acceptable use policy (https://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/policies/itpolicy.html). ITS will inform each individual via email when they begin the grace period and ITS will send periodic reminders throughout the grace period to help keep them aware of the approach of the end of the grace period. During the grace period, they will have the option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services, which will keep the individual's UH email account active and available.\nAfter the grace period ends, if an individual has enrolled in our 'Ohana online services, their UH email account, along with all email messages and folders stored in the account, will continue to be available contingent on annual renewal of this enrollment. The UH email account, and all email messages and documents stored in the account, will be no longer be available should an individual fail to enroll in 'Ohana online services prior to the end of the grace period.\n\n\nRetiring Faculty/Staff, and Emeriti\nFaculty and Staff who retire from UH, as well as Emeriti, are allowed continued use of their UH Email Account. Use of the UH Email Account is subject to an annual renewal. Email reminders will be sent to Retirees and Emeriti regarding their respective upcoming renewal deadline. For more details about basic online services for Retirees and Emeriti, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/933.\n\n\nDeceased Student or Employee/Affiliate\nStudent\nIn the unfortunate event that a UH student should pass away, the following procedure will be used by ITS:\n\n    \n    The appropriate Dean of Student Services notifies the ITS Help Desk of the event. The following information is required so that the ITS Help Desk can create an auto-reply message.\n    \n        UH Username or UH Number of the deceased\n        Name of the deceased\n    \n    \n    \n    ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean) is:\n    This is an automated message:\n    This email is no longer available.\n    \n    ITS clears the password.\n    On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted.\n\nEmployee/Affiliate\nIn the unfortunate event that an employee or UH affiliated person should pass away, the following procedure will be used by ITS:\n\n    \n    Dean/Director notifies ITS of the event and ITS will change the account’s password. The following information is required so that ITS can create an auto-reply message and to ensure that no new email is accepted\n    \n        Name of the deceased\n        Responsible party in the unit to whom external correspondents can be referred, typically the manager, department chair, dean, director, etc. For this individual, we require their name, title, and email address.\n    \n    \n    Dean/Director notifies ITS of the email agent who will be responsible for reviewing the email of the deceased to ensure that no official business is outstanding. The email agent would be the person entrusted to go through the desk of the deceased to separate personal items from UH business materials.\n    \n    ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean/Director) is:\n    This is an automated message.\n    First name Last name is no longer working at the University of Hawaii.\n    You may contact Responsible-First name Responsible-Last name, Responsible-Title, at responsible-email-address.\n    \n    ITS clears password and forwards it to the email agent\n    The email agent identified reviews all old emails to identify any unread messages that require official action/response. These are either replied to or forwarded as appropriate based on context. Upon completion of the review and handling, the email agent can either delete all messages or ask ITS to do so.\n    On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted.\n\n\n\nAccount Termination\nUniversity unit authorities (e.g. Vice Presidents, Chancellors, Vice Chancellors, Deans, Directors, Department Head, Administrative Officers, etc.) can request a UH Account termination for a faculty, staff, or affiliate under their purview by making a formal request on departmental letterhead. The signature of the University unit authority (or their designee) is required. When the termination is requested, it is possible that the individual using the UH Account has established additional affiliations with UH, such as becoming a student or becoming a faculty or staff with another UH unit. ITS will research all termination requests in order to ascertain if there are additional affiliations by the individual. If there are no other affiliations, the UH Email Account will be flagged for termination. By default, the UH Account will remain open for 180 days. If access to the UH Account must be immediately cut-off, the letter must explicitly request this.\nRequests should be sent via File Drop to the ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu"

    "title": "Installing PuTTY",
    "content": "Overview\nPuTTY is a free implementation of SSH (Secure Shell) and Telnet for Windows platforms.\nPuTTY does not have SFTP capabilities, if you need SFTP please see Askus article 1740 for an ITS supported SFTP application.\nIn newer versions of Windows 10 and above, you can now enable SSH capabilities in the Command Prompt application. For information on how to enable SSH in Command Prompt, please see Askus article 1874.\nSystem Requirements\nThe PuTTY Client does not have any special hardware or software requirements. The PuTTY client is compatible with any computer running Microsoft Windows 10 or later.\n \nInstalling the Putty Package\n\n    \n    PuTTY can be downloaded from here When downloading the installation file, you can save it on the Desktop for ease of access.\n    \n    \n    It’s recommended to exit from all other programs before installing the PuTTY package.\n    \n    \n    When the download is completed, go to the Desktop and open the installation file called putty-0.73-installer.msi (.msi is a Windows Installer Package).\n    \n    \n    Windows will ask if you want to run the installer, click Run.\n     \n    \n\n\n    \n    The Putty SetupWizard will start. Click Next.\n    \n    \n    \n    The Setup Wizard will now prompt you to select the installation folder. Click Next to accept the default location or \"change\" to define a different folder.\n    \n    \n    \n    The Setup Wizard will then prompt you to select which features to install. By default it will install everything except a shortcut.\n    \n    \n    \n    It is suggested for ease of access to add the shortcut option by selecting the “Will be installed on local hard drive” option. Once this is done click \"Install\" to accept the chosen components\n    \n    \n    \n    Windows will then ask if you want to let the PuTTY Installer make changes to your computer to complete the installation, press “yes” and the installer will allow PuTTY to install\n    \n    \n    The Setup Wizard will now install PuTTY onto your computer.\n    \n    \n    Click Finish to complete the installation (In order to skip viewing the README file, you will want to uncheck the check box).\n    \n\nStarting the Program\n\n    \n    After the installation, you will find a new icon on your desktop for starting PuTTY. To set up an SSH client to connect to uhunix.hawaii.edu double click the icon\n    \n    \n    \n    To connect to a remote computer, set up a session name and then enter the Host Name or IP address along with the designated port.\n    \n    \n    To connect to the uhunix server use the following settings:\n    \n        \n        Host Name: uhunix.hawaii.edu\n        \n        \n        Port Number: 22\n        \n        (Please note that sessions can be saved as shown above)\n         \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    If this is the first time you connect to a new Host, you will receive a Host Identification message informing you that an encryption key for this remote machine is being created. Click Yes to accept this key and continue.\n    \n     \n    \n    \n    You will then be prompted for your UH username and password. Fill in the correct information and click OK. You are now connected to your UHUNIX account.\n    \n    \n\n \nUninstalling PuTTY\nThe PuTTY software can be uninstalled using the Programs control panel through the following steps:\n\n    \n    In the Start menu, search for the setting Add or remove programs.\n    \n    \n    \n    In the Search bar look for PuTTY.\n    \n    \n    \n    Click on the PuTTY release version and click Uninstall.\n    \n    \n    \n    Click Uninstall in the pop up box to confirm.\n    \n    \n    \n    The last step will ask if you want to let the PuTTY installer make changes to your computer to complete the uninstallation, press yes and the uninstaller will remove PuTTY."

    "content": "Enabling the Lock Screen\n\n    Open your System Preferences. This can be found either in your dock or by clicking on the apple logo in the top-left corner of the screen and selecting \"System Preferences\" in the drop-down menu.\n    \n       \n    Select Security and Privacy. This will be in the top row of icons.\n    \n       \n    This window gives you access to setting lock screen delay, changing or setting new passwords, disk encryption, firewall, and app permissions. For this article, we will focus on the lock screen delay setting, which is located in the \"General\" tab.\n    Set a password if you have not already and click on the first checkbox to require a password. Click on the \"Immediately\" option in the drop-down menu. This will cause your laptop to immediately initiate the lock screen whenever the screen turns off or the screensaver turns on.\n    \n       \n    Please consider using a strong, complex password for your lock screen, as it is your only defense against attackers who have physical access to your Mac. Unlike mobile devices, there is no limit to how many chances an attacker has to crack your password, which makes it easier for brute force attacks utilizing wordlists and rainbow tables (password databases) to quickly guess your password.\n    If you need guidance for setting a strong password, please refer to this article on Password Guidelines.\n\nLocking Methods\nThere are a few different ways of locking your screen: Keychain Access, keyboard shortcuts, and Hot Corners. One is not necessarily better than the other; whichever one you feel most comfortable with doing is the best choice.\n\n    \n    Keychain Access\n    \n    The Keychain Access method uses a built-in utility to add a button to the top-right portion of the menu bar. This method does not require you to memorize anything and gives graphical feedback, unlike the other two methods, making this one the easiest to remember.\n    \n       \n    \n        Navigate to the Utilities Folder in Applications and double click on Keychain Access.  This can be found by opening Finder, clicking on Applications on the left-hand menu and scrolling down to the folder.\n        \n            \n        Once in Keychain Access, open the Preferences.  This can be found in the top bar by clicking on \"Keychain Access\".\n        \n           \n        Check the \"Show keychain status in menu bar\" box. After doing so, you can close Keychain Access. This will make the lock icon appear in the menu bar.\n        \n           \n        To lock you screen, click on the lock button, and select \"Lock Screen\". Now your laptop will require a password when it is next woken up.\n        \n               \n        \n        Keyboard Shortcut\n        \n        This method is the easiest to implement of the three due to not requiring you to access any settings, but it does require you to memorize a few keystrokes. There are two different keystrokes for different Macs. Once these keys are pressed, your screen will instantly turn black and initiate the lock screen.\n        \n            Control + Shift + Eject are the keys to press for Macs with the eject button in the upper right corner of the keyboard.\n            Control + Shift + Power are the keys to press for Macs without the eject button.\n        \n        Note that both methods will work with Macs that have the eject button, so memorize whichever one is easiest for you. On newer MacBooks, the power button is located where the eject key is on older models.\n        \n        Hot Corners\n        \n        Hot Corners is a feature that allows for different functions to execute when you drag your cursor to a corner of the screen. You can use this to set a corner to initiate either the screensaver or to turn the display off. All four corners can be customized to do different things, so when setting this up, remember which corner you put the lock screen on.\n        \n            Open Mission Control. This can be found in System Preferences in the first row of icons.\n            \n               \n            Click on Hot Corners. This button is located on the lower left corner of the Mission Control window. A drop-down menu should appear at the top of the Mission Control window.\n            \n               \n            Choose a corner to \"Put Display to Sleep\". Alternatively, you can choose to start the screensaver instead, which will also initiate the lock screen underneath it."

    "content": "Electronic or digital signing must adhere to University policies, including EP 2.218.\nUsing a Digital ID to sign a PDF\nWhat is a Digital ID?\nA digital ID is like an electronic driver’s license or passport that proves your identity. A digital ID usually contains your name and email address, the name of the organization that issued it, a serial number, and an expiration date. Digital IDs are used for certificate security and digital signatures.\n\nDigital IDs contain two keys: the public key locks, or encrypts data; the private key unlocks, or decrypts that data. When you sign PDFs, you use the private key to apply your digital signature. The public key is in a certificate that you distribute to others. For example, you can send the certificate to those who want to validate your signature or identity. Store your digital ID in a safe place, because it contains your private key that others can use to decrypt your information.\nTo sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a self-signed digital ID in Acrobat or Adobe Reader.\nCreate a self-signed digital ID\nSelf-signed digital IDs can be adequate for personal use or small-to-medium businesses. Their use should be limited to parties that have established mutual trust.\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/digital-ids.html#create_a_self_signed_digital_id\nUsing the created digital IDs to sign a PDF\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1812\nTrusting Self-Signed digital certificates\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1811\n \nUsing Fill & Sign on non-fillable PDFs\nAn interactive or fillable form contains fields that you can select or fill in. For such forms, the Fill & Sign tool displays only the Sign option. \n\nA flat form does not have interactive fields. It could be a paper form or PDF that hasn’t been optimized for form filling. The Fill & Sign tool automatically detects the form fields like text fields, comb fields, checkboxes, and radio button. You can also manually add text and other symbols anywhere on the form using the Fill & Sign tool if required.\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/fill-and-sign.html#fill_your_PDF_form\n \nRelated Articles\nTrusting Self-Signed Digital Signatures\nUsing a Digital Signature in Acrobat DC\nDigital Signatures on University Purchasing Documents(PDF, 256kb)"

    "content": "In this article are instructions on the use of the external drive encryption software from VeraCrypt. VeraCrypt works across Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux (https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Supported%20Operating%20Systems.html).\nTable of Contents\n\n    Encrypt External Drive\n    Mounting Encrypted External Drive\n    Dismounting the Encrypted External Drive\n    Creating an Encrypted File Container\n    Mounting an Encrypted File Container\n    Dismounting an Encrypted File Container\n    Links\n\nDownload and Install VeraCrypt\nDownload VeraCrypt for your operating system from here: https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html and install it onto your computer.\nExternal Drive - Full Disk Encryption\nEncrypt External Drive\n***IMPORTANT: With an attached external drive (e.g., a USB drive), the setup process will delete all existing files on this external drive. Backup any files on this drive you wish to save or restore. Be sure you select the right drive and partition before encrypting***\n\n    Open VeraCrypt and select Create Volume.\n    In the VeraCrypt Volume Creation choose where you wish the VeraCrypt volume to be created. A VeraCrypt volume can reside in a file, which is also called container, in a partition or drive. For these instructions, choose the second option, Encrypt a non-system partition/drive, and then click Next.\n    Click on Standard VeraCrypt Volume, then click Next.\n    Make sure the Never save history option is checked, then click on Select Device.\n    Select the external drive you wish to encrypt. Make sure you select the \"Partition\".\n    Verify the correct partition is populated, and then click Next.\n    If you want to delete all of the data on your drive or if the drive is empty, select the Create encrypted volume and format it option. If you want to preserve and encrypt the files on your drive, select the Encrypt partition in place option. Click Next when ready.\n    ***IMPORTANT: With an attached external drive (e.g., a USB drive), the setup process will delete all existing files on this external drive. Backup any files on this drive you wish to save or restore.***\n    The default Encryption Algorithm should be AES and the default Hash Algorithm should be SHA-512. If not, change to AES and SHA-512, the click Next.\n    Verify the Volume Size matches the size of the external drive you are encrypting. You should not be able to modify this. Click Next when are sure you have the right volume selected.\n    Enter a complex password, which will be used to encrypt the volume. Follow the guidance in this window to help you create a complex password. Click Next after you have entered the password twice.\n    Select Yes for this screen and then click Next.\n    Verify the Filesystem is set to exFat. Now move the mouse as randomly as possible within the Volume Creation Wizard window until the Randomness Collected From Mouse Movements indicator becomes green. The longer you move the mouse the better, as this significantly increases the cryptographic strength of the encryption keys. Click Format when ready.\n    You will receive a final warning about all data being erased on this external drive. Click Yes when ready.\n    ***IMPORTANT: With an attached external drive (e.g., a USB drive), the setup process will delete all existing files on this external drive. Backup any files on this drive you wish to save or restore.***\n    The external drive will now begin formatting and encrypting.\n    Once complete, you may receive this warning. In this example, when the external drive was connected the E: drive was used. Click OK when ready.\n    The external drive is now encrypted.\n\nMounting Encrypted External Drive\n\n    From the main VeraCrypt window select an available drive letter. This will be where the VeraCrypt encrypted external drive will be mounted. Then click on the Select Device button.\n    Select the partition you used for the setup. In this example we are selecting Partition 1. Click OK when ready.\n    Confirm the partition you selected is populating. In this example you will see \\Device\\Harddisk1\\Partition1. Once confirmed, click Mount.\n    Enter the password you used to create the encrypted external drive. Click OK when ready.\n    Verify the drive you selected is now populated with the encrypted external drive you connected to your computer. Click Exit when ready. You will now see the drive letter selected as a location to copy files.\n\nDismounting the Encrypted External Drive\n\n    Select the volume from the list of mounted volumes in the main VeraCrypt window and then click Dismount.\n    To make files stored on the encrypted external drive accessible again, follow the steps in the Mounting the Encrypted External Drive section.\n    If you restart Windows or turn off your computer, the encrypted external drive will be also be dismounted.\n    Regardless of which way the encrypted external drive is dismounted, the files in the encrypted external drive remain encrypted.\n\nVeracrypt Container Encryption\nCreating an Encrypted File Container\n\n    After installing VeraCypt, open and select Create Volume.\n    In the VeraCrypt Volume Creation choose where you wish the VeraCrypt volume to be created. A VeraCrypt volume can reside in a file, which is also called container, in a partition or drive. For these instructions, choose the first option, Create an encrypted File Container, and then click Next.\n    Select Standard VeraCrypt volume and then click Next. As the option is selected by default, you can just click Next.\n    Select where the VeraCrypt volume (file container) is to be created. Note that a VeraCrypt container is like any normal file and can be moved and deleted. Click Select File.\n    In this example, we will create the VeraCrypt volume in the folder F:\\Data\\ and the filename of the volume (container) will be \"My Volume\".\n    \n        You may choose any other filename and location based on your situation (e.g., on a USB Drive). Please note the file My Volume does not exist – VeraCrypt will create this volume as part of this setup.\n        IMPORTANT: If you select an existing file, this file will be overwritten by VeraCrypt and replaced with a newly created volume.\n        Select the desired path (where you wish the container to be created) in the file selector (for example, F:\\Data).\n        Type the desired container file name (for example, My Volume) in the File name box and then click Save.         \n        \n        In the Volume Location window, click Next.\n        The default Encryption Algorithm should be AES and the default Hash Algorithm should be SHA-512. If not, change to AES and SHA-512, the click Next.\n        Enter this size of the VeraCrypt container. This window informs you how much space is available. Click Next when ready.\n        Enter a complex password, which will be used to encrypt the volume. Follow the guidance in this window to help you create a complex password. Select Next after you have entered the password twice.\n        Move the mouse as randomly as possible within the Volume Creation Wizard window until the Randomness Collected From Mouse Movements indicator becomes green. The longer you move the mouse the better, as this significantly increases the cryptographic strength of the encryption keys. \t\tClick Formatwhen ready.\n        VeraCrypt will now create a file called  My Volume in the folder F:\\Data. This file will be a VeraCrypt container (it will contain the encrypted VeraCrypt volume). The following box will appear once the encrytion is complete:\n        The VeraCrypt volume (file container) has now been successfully created. Click Exit.\n        Refer to the Mounting the Encrypted File Container steps to begin using this created encrypted file container.\n    \n    Mounting an Encrypted File Container\n    \n        From the main VeraCrypt window select a drive letter. This will be the drive letter the VeraCrypt container is mounted. For this example, the M drive has been selected. You will choose any available drive letter.\n        Click Select File.\n        Browse to the container file you previously created (e.g., My Volume), clock on the file, and then select Open.\n        Next, click Mount.\n        Enter the Password you provided during the setup process. Then Select the PRF algorithm used during the creation of the volume (SHA-512 is the default PRF used by VeraCrypt).\n        \n            If you do not remember which PRF was used, select Autodetection. Select OK when ready. VeraCrypt will now attempt to mount the volume.\n        \n        \n        The virtual disk has now been successfully mounted. In this example the M Drive has been mounted. The virtual disk is entirely encrypted (including file names, allocation tables, free space, etc.). \t\tYou can now save, copy, or move files to this virtual disk and they will be encrypted. \t\tWhen accessing a file on the mounted volume you will not be asked for the password again. You can open the mounted volume by selecting it on the list as shown in the screenshot below (blue selection) and then double-clicking on the selected item.\n        You can also browse to the mounted volume the way you normally browse to any other types of volumes. Copy files/folder to and from the VeraCrypt volume as you would with any normal drive.\n    \n    Dismounting an Encrypted File Container\n    \n        Select the volume from the list of mounted volumes in the main VeraCrypt window and then click Dismount. To make files stored on the volume accessible again, follow the steps in the Mounting the Encrypted File Container section.\n        If you restart Windows or turn off your computer, the volume will be also be dismounted.\n        Regardless of which way the volume is dismounted, the files in the encrypted container remain encrypted.\n    \n    Links\n    \n        VeraCrypt Documentation: https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Documentation.html\n        VeraCrypt Download: https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html\n        VeraCrypt Setup: https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Beginner%27s%20Tutorial.html\n        VeraCrypt Operating Systems: https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Supported%20Operating%20Systems.html"

This will allow your servers to be isolated from other servers within the ITS Data Center. This will reduce the risk that your server will be adversely affected by another server, or vice versa.\n \nYou may elect to have your services behind the ITS firewall. ITS will work with you to determine what traffic should or should not be blocked from your servers.\n \nMaintaining the security of your servers is your responsibility. You should make sure software is patched, malware is blocked, passwords are secure and access lists are managed. If for some reason your server is compromised, and it becomes a threat to the greater UH community (e.g. it is being used as a host to attack other services), ITS reserves the right to remove your equipment from the network or block its traffic. If this occurs, ITS will notify you immediately.\n \n\nITS access to your equipment\nFor safety purposes, ITS reserves the right to inspect your cabinet as necessary to ensure power, networking and other standards are being correctly followed. ITS may also take immediate steps to remedy any safety and operational issues.\n \nSpecial service requests\nIn general, ITS believes this service is structured well to support a wide-range of UH users. Of course, it’s possible that some very large installations or very unique situations will arise where this service may not work perfectly for some people. In these situations, ITS is happy to meet with you to discuss your special needs, and see if we can tailor the existing service to make it workable for you.

This means that the number of computing devices in each rack will be limited by how much heat they produce which is usually directly correlated to how much electricity they use.\n \nThe table below describes the technology and constraints of the ITS data center at a high level. If you have needs outside of these specifications, you should consult with ITS. We can describe what other options we may be able to support.\n \n\n    \n        \n            \n             \n            \n            \n            ITC Data Center\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Type of Racks\n            \n            \n            • Chatsworth Terra-Frame\n            • Vertical rails\n            • Cage nut mounting.\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Capacity\n            \n            \n            • Generally 20 power connections per rack but higher options may be available with different cooling approaches\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Power & Cooling\n            \n            \n            • 120V or 208V\n            • Chimney cooling on racks or optional rear door coolers (configuration to be determined by ITS)\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Network\n            \n            \n            • One network connection will be provided for each device installed within the rack.\n            • ITS will provide 1Gb connections. 10G connection to rack is available for an additional cost.\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Weight\n            \n            \n            • The total weight of a full rack cannot exceed 3000 lbs.\n            \n        \n    \n\n \nAppendix 3: Setup and Installation of Your Equipment\nOnce you’ve decided to use the Co-Location Service, ITS can work with you to get your equipment\nset-up and installed within the data center. The table below describes the assistance they can provide you during the setup of your equipment.\n \n \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Activity\n            \n            \n            Description\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Racking\n            \n            \n            ITS will work with you to physically install your equipment in racks within the data center. If you have requested combo locks for your racks, ITS will acquire and install these.\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Power\n            \n            \n            A standard power configuration is defined in this SLA. If you have power needs beyond these standards, ITS will try to meet them. Of course, ITS will be limited by the constraints of its data center facilities and equipment.\n             \n            Please note it is possible that future co-location rates may be based, in part, upon the power configuration of your rack. If this occurs, your requests for additional power may result in your co-location fees being raised in the future. (As stated earlier in the SLA, ITS will review rates annually and will communicate changes to the rates well in advance to all customers.)\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Network\n            \n            \n            ITS will make sure the physical network is set-up correctly up to your cabinet.\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Domain Name Service (DNS)\n            \n            \n            Based on your input, ITS will ensure that domain name service is properly configured for your devices.\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            ITS Firewall Rules\n            \n            \n            Based on your input, ITS will ensure that the ITS firewall rules are properly set-up for your devices.\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Backup\n            \n            \n            At the present time, ITS does not offer backup services.\n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Other\n            \n            \n            Additional professional services are available to support you and your team.

(CIS Control 10.2)\n            \n                Example: Backup all data as well as application configuration files to ensure a quicker recovery.\n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Protect Backups:\n            Ensure  that backups are properly protected via physical security or encryption  when they are stored, as well as when they are moved across the  network. This includes remote backups and cloud services. (CIS Control  10.4)\n            \n                Backups should be BOTH physically secured and encrypted.\n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            Ensure Backups Have At least One Non-Continuously Addressable Destination:\n            Ensure  that all backups have at least one backup destination that is not  continuously addressable through operating system calls. (CIS Control  10.5)\n            \n                The backup destination should not be a device on an  open network, and it should be properly secured via permissions and  access controls.\n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    Example backup scenario if NOT choosing backups from ITS\n    \n        \n        Purchase an additional virtual server and set it up as a storage repository for backups.\n        \n        \n        The backup solution should have a means of encrypting data in transit and in storage for sensitive or regulated data.\n        \n            \n            An SSL certificate may need to be obtained, depending on how the backup solution works.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n        Purchase a physical device or server that is meant for backups (i.e., a NAS unit).\n        \n            \n            ITS does not provide support with setting up physical devices, the customer will need to contact the vendor.\n            \n            \n            Customer  will need to ensure the device can be secured and protected physically  and over the network (i.e., access control rules).\n            \n            \n            Minimum security standards still apply.\n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\nWhat if a customer decides to backup to the cloud (Google, AWS, etc.)?\n\n    \n    The  customer will be responsible for vetting third-party risk and  constructing backup services that meet the minimum security standards  and backup requirements, as applicable. \n    \n    \n    Consult with Data Governance (https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/) before using a third-party cloud backup service.\n    \n        \n        The additional Data Governance requirements for third-party IT services will also be required for the customer to complete.\n        \n    \n    \n\nAdditional References for Further Reading\n\n    \n    ITS Minimum Security Standards - https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/\n    \n    \n    CIS Controls - https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-implementation-groups/\n    \n    \n    \n    NIST 800-171 - https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-2/final"

    "content": "Before installing and configuring Duo MFA, please ensure you have accounts created on your server matching UH username accounts. Duo MFA will be configured to push on UH usernames, so any username that does not match an existing UH username (i.e., \"admin\" or \"user\") could fail, thus locking you out of your server. \n    Please also note that using variations of your username (i.e. \"jdoe\" vs \"johndoe\") for the server account that does not match your own username could potentially lock another person out of using Duo MFA, if they have that as an existing UH username.\n     \n\n\n\n    Email itscs@hawaii.edu to inform  us that you'd like to setup Duo MFA on your Windows server, and we  will add your server to our Duo environment. Please verify that you are enrolled in Duo MFA. See Getting setup for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for more information.\n    \n    Please include the following information in your request:\n    \n    Hostname or VM name\n    IP address\n    \n    NOTE: This is only provided to virtual server customers hosted under ITS Managed Services.\n    \n     \n    We will filedrop you three keys, which are required in the Duo configuration on the server.\n    \n    Integration key\n    Secret key\n    API hostname\n    \n    We will also filedrop you the Duo installer for Windows.\n     \n    Before you begin with the installation, please ensure that a local account matching your exact UH username has been created on the server. Duo MFA will be configured to push on UH usernames, so any username that does not match an existing UH username (i.e., \"admin\" or \"user\") could fail, thus locking you out of the server.\n    \n    Please also note that using variations of your username (i.e. \"jdoe\" vs \"johndoe\") for the server account that does not match your own username could potentially lock another person out of using Duo MFA, if they have that as an existing UH username.\n     \n    On your Windows server, copy the Duo installer on to the desktop and run it. Be sure to run as Administator.\n     \n    At the welcome screen, click Next.\n    \n    \n    \n     \n    Paste the API hostname that was filedropped to you in the field.

    "title": "ITS Service Level Agreement - Virtual Server Hosting Service",
    "content": "Description\nThe Virtual Server Hosting Service provides the UH community with access to virtual servers running a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or a Microsoft Windows operating system. ITS utilizes a VMware cluster for the provisioning of the virtual servers. The size/configuration of the virtual servers can change over time as needs change.\n \nShow Stoppers\nThere are some scenarios where this service will not be appropriate.  Below are some examples:\n\n    This service may not be used where PCI compliance is required.\n     \n    Hardware requirements for peripherals such as sound cards.\n    \n        A colocation request may have to be considered instead.\n         \n    \n    \n    Operating systems that are not ITS-supported (i.e. Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)\n     \n    This limitation is due to our need to provide monthly auditing of OS patching.\n     \n    Firewall rules that are deemed to be a security risk by the ITS TI-Security team.\n    \n        I.e. Open MySQL to the world.\n    \n    \n\nBenefits\nInfrastructure Benefits\n\n    The environmentally hardened IT Center Data Center can reduce the risk of your equipment being damaged or unavailable due to natural disasters.\n     \n    Efficient power and cooling reduces UH’s use of natural resources and overall expenses.\n     \n    Highly redundant components; reliable power and cooling will increase the uptime of your hosted applications.\n     \n    Continue to have full control to your system without worries about buying, installing, supporting or replacing hardware.\n\nHosted Virtual Server Benefits\n\n    New servers can be set-up within a few days so you no longer have to go through long procurement processes to get your equipment.\n     \n    Can grow or shrink your virtual server over time; ensures you don’t spend too much money by over-configuring your systems.\n    \n        Caveats include:\n        \n            Shrinking disk on on Windows is generally not recommended.\n            While we can increase resources without a reboot; decreasing resources will require a reboot.\n             \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    OS upgrade support for major releases\n    \n        A new virtual server of similar configuration will be provided at no additional cost for a period of 1 month to facilitate migration.\n        Where possible IP addresses will be preserved upon request.\n        CNAME(s) will be updated as needed for cutover to the new virtual server.\n         \n    \n    \n    Duo integration is supported at no additional cost\n    \n        The catch is that only UH Usernames are supported since the Duo namespace is integrated with the UH Login username space.\n        Multi-factor is highly recommended for securing shell access.\n    \n    \n\nOptional Benefits, at Additional Cost\nYour server can be backed-up to a second location providing additional protecting from data loss even in the case of a major disaster.\nOperating Systems\nAvailable\nOperating systems are no longer available once they reach end-of-life.  New operating systems are added as ITS fully incorporates them into its deployment scripts.\nHighly recommended:\n\n    Multifactor authentication is highly recommended for securing remote access, such as RDP and SSH.\n\nOS Support Resources\nOS support is not included in this service, nor is there support for the applications you plan to install. There are resources available online and the UH App Dev community via their LISTSERV list may be able to help since many of them manage operating systems. ITS staff also participate on this list. Here are some resources to consider:\n\n    UH App Dev community: https://uhawaii.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UHIAM/pages/13402608/App+Developers+Forum.  You will need to sign up.\n    RHEL mailing lists: https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo\n    Red Hat Services: https://www.redhat.com/en/services\n\nITS Responsibilities\nInitial\n\n    Review the \"Production Readiness Questionnaire\" and Virtual Server Intake Form.\n    \n    \n    Perform initial installation of the new virtual server's OS\n    \n    Note: ITS will not have access to the operating system (OS) once it is handed over to the owner.\n    \n    \n    Provide vCenter console access to the new virtual server\n    \n    Provide for virtual server reboot, shutdown, and the viewing of resource utilization statistics.\n    \n    \n    Register the virtual server in the InfoSec Server Registration database.\n    \n    \n    Preinstall backup client if backups are included with the new virtual server request. Backups are required, but customers can use their own backup service.\n\nOngoing\n\n    Provide firewall changes as needed, upon request and pending vetting from TI-Sec.\n    Response to requests for support for using this service. \n    \n        Requests can be sent to itscs@hawaii.edu.\n        Support for the hosted applications is not provided.\n    \n    \n    Adjust virtual server resource utilization as needed, upon request.\n    Perform monthly security audit to ensure that the OS is being updated monthly.\n    Provide annual billing.

Links to policies can be found at https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/\n    Ensure that the appropriate firewall rules are specified.\n    Ensure that a backup strategy for institutional data protection is planned from the outset.\n\nAdministrative\nYou must:\n\n    Identify at least one full-time staff as the virtual server's system administrator.\n    \n        Ensure that at least one full-time staff member is assigned system and application administration responsibilities. Students cannot be the primary system administrator.\n        Let ITS know in a timely fashion when changes to personnel are necessary, for example, when a designated system administrator leaves your department.\n        It is highly recommended that you have a backup system administrator assigned to your virtual server.\n         \n    \n    \n    When requesting additional CPUs for example, ensure that any associated increases in application licensing costs are appropriately addressed.\n    \n        E.G.: An increase in CPU resources might required increase Microsoft SQL Server costs.\n         \n    \n    \n    If requesting ITS backups\n    \n        Install the ITS backup client (see reference section at the end of this document).  \n        Ensure that you have purchased sufficient disk space for your backups.\n         \n    \n    \n    Annually confirm the virtual server registration in the InfoSec Server Registration database (you will receive an email reminder).\n    \n        For more information: https://hawaii.edu/askus/1312.\n         \n    \n    \n    Make the requested annual payment to ITS for resources utilized.\n\nData Protection\nEnsure your familiarity with and comprehension of the following:\n\n    The UH Information Security Program: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/infosecprogram/.\n    Protecting Sensitive Information at UH: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266.\n    Know and understand the data classification that is applicable to the data being stored and accessed on the virtual server https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/institutional-data-classification-levels/.\n    Inform ITS in advance when planning to host protected information (HIPAA, FERPA, PCI, PII, etc) on the virtual server.\n    Properly manage information by assigning at least one full-time staff member as a protected data compliance officer.\n    Implement a backup strategy to protect institutional data.\n\nSecurity\nMaintaining the security of your virtual servers is the customer responsibility. The customer should make sure software is patched, malware is blocked, passwords are secure and access lists are managed. If for some reason you experience a virtual server compromise, and it becomes a threat to the greater UH community (e.g. it is being used as a host to attack other services), ITS reserves the right to block its network traffic. If this occurs, ITS will notify you immediately. \nUniversity guidelines and general best practices for securing the hosted virtual servers according to established policies are available here: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266.\n\n    Manage the applications, administer user access, etc.\n    Perform monthly (minimally) OS patching utilizing the UH patch servers to ensure that OS patching activities are auditable.\n    Mitigate critical application vulnerabilities in a timely fashion (within 7 calendar days is recommended).\n    Ensure continued compliance with Minimum Security Standards for Virtual Server and all Desktops and devices that may connect to the Server https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/.\n    Proactively upgrade your Operating System before it is End of Service Life (EOSL).\n    \n        ITS will contact the server administrator on record when systems are becoming EOSL. It is the administrator's reponsiblity to respond in a timely manner and work on upgrading to server. Failure to upgrade will leave your OS vulnerable. ITS reserves the right to shut down or block from the network.\n    \n    \n\nPolicies\nITS will continue to ensure that security remains a priority, and will verify ongoing compliance to executive policies. Examples of such policies regarding security and data handling would be EP 2.210 (Information Technology Resources Policy), EP 2.214 (Institutional Data Classification & Information Security Guidelines) & EP 2.215 (Protected Data). \nExcerpt from EP 2.214\n\"3.    As stated in Executive Policy EP2.215, Information Technology Services (ITS) has the full authority to enforce technical measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of protected data that are stored or transmitted, whether intentionally or unintentionally, on University systems and networks, including but not limited to immediate disconnection of compromised systems and devices from the University network.\n4.    ITS has the authority to conduct network and device scanning to identify security weaknesses in any University information system, device, or network that may compromise sensitive information or the operations and availability of institutional services.\n    ITS also has the authority to require all servers operating on the University network be regularly scanned for sensitive information, vulnerabilities and be protected in accordance with appropriate data security guidelines based on data classification categories.\n5.    To better protect the University’s Institutional Data, ITS may require departments/units/programs to periodically report on the data element/records that they manage. Reporting requirements administered by ITS include PII and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) surveys and server registrations.\nThe PII survey is part of an HRS §487N-7 requirement where UH must annually prepare a report describing the information systems that contain personal information. ITS is responsible for submitting this report and maintains a secure online system for units to report such systems. Chancellors and Vice Presidents are responsible to ensure that units under their purview report systems containing Protected Data and update the information at least annually. \"\nReferences:\nUH Policies Related to Information Security: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/\nEP 2.210: https://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.210\nEP 2.214: http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.214\nEP 2.215: http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.215\nApplications Support\n\n    Install and support the required application(s).\n    Ensure ongoing compliance with UH Executive Policies such as EP 2.210, EP 2.214, and EP 2.215.\n    Patch/upgrade application(s) as required.\n    Upgrade your backup client as needed.\n\nVirtual Server Ownership Costs\nBaseline Virtual Server Host Configuration\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            Baseline Configuration\n            \n        \n        \n            Quantity\n            Component\n        \n        \n            75 GB\n            System disk\n        \n        \n            4 GB\n            RAM\n        \n        \n            1\n            vCPU (2.2GHz or better)\n        \n        \n            1\n            \n            Operating System\n            \n        \n        \n            1\n            \n            Named VPN account (requires a UH Username)\n            \n        \n        \n            1\n            \n            vCenter Console access (requires a VPN account)\n            \n        \n        \n            1000 Mbps\n            Network connection (non-dedicated)\n        \n    \n\n\nPrice Structure\n\nThe information in the following table is from the ITS 2023 Price List, and current as of 02/14/2023.\n\nInstructions: Select one of the baseline configurations.  Determine which if any of the optional cost items are to be included.  \nOptional cost items may be specified with the initial request or requested at a later time.  \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            Baseline Configurations\n            Cost\n            Notes\n        \n        \n            Standard virtual server\n            $280.00\n            \n            See Configuration table above.

VMware doesn't support decreasing disk allocation size, e.g., decrease a 100GB disk to 75GB.\n\nFirewall Requests\nFirewall requests are subject to review and approval by the TI security team.\n\n    Requests are usually processed during normal business hours.\n    Most firewall configuration requests should receive a reply within 2 business days.\n    By default all traffic is blocked incoming to virtual servers and are behind a firewall.\n    By default all traffic is open outgoing from a virtual server.\n\nNote: the default the firewall configuration is very restrictive.  For example, requests to register a CAS URL will result in troubleshooting to figure out why CAS is not working and it will be determined that the firewall configuration must be adjusted.\nBackup/Restores\nNote that file-level backups are performed when using the ITS backup solution. One implication is that only database exports are useful for backups. When requesting backups you will have the opportunity to indicate which directories are to be included.\n\n    Backups are provided at additional cost and based on resource use.\n    Backup strategy\n    \n        Daily - incremental backups\n        Weekly - full backup\n    \n    \n    Retention policy\n    \n        7 calendar days\n    \n    \n    Restores\n    \n        Available upon request. \n        At this time no additional fees are applicable.\n        See section \"Availability, item \"New support requests\" for response times.\n    \n    \n\nService Owner\n\n    Director of Technology Infrastructure, Information Technology Services (ITS)\n\nService Representative\n\n    TI-Managed Services team (TI-MS)\n    Contact information: itscs@hawaii.edu\n\nService Criticality\n\n    Business Critical\n\nDisclaimer\n\n    \n    ITS reserves the right to modify or revoke this service at any time, in response to and not limited to the following:\n    \n        \n        Changes in infrastructure applications and operating system licensing and/or resources and allocation.\n        \n        \n        Response to security breaches, in which a hosted server may be potentially shut down to avoid a breach.\n        \n    \n    \n\nReferences\n\n    ITIL: https://www.itilnews.com/index.php?pagename=ITIL_Service_Catalogue_How_to_produce_a_Service_Catalogue\n    Version 1: VMWare Hosted Solutions, https://www.hawaii.edu/its/servers-data-center-storage-services/vmware-hosted-solutions/\n    Online pricing/request form: https://www.hawaii.edu/its/dcservices/virtualmachine.php\n    Terminology: virtual machine vs virtual server\n    Installing Backup Client\n    \n        RHEL: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1732         \n        Windows: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1716\n    \n    \n\nChange Log:\n\n    2023-01-09: Formatting and backup terminology updated; replaced \"Bacula\" with \"backup service/client\".

    "title": "Duo Mobile app 4.0 update",
    "content": "Overview\nThe Duo Mobile 4.0 version of the app is a significant update to the user interface.  This update will be released on the following schedule:\n\n    For iOS: October 11 through 18, 2021\n    For Android: October 11 through 15, 2021\n\nDuo Mobile 4.0 requires\n\n    iOS 13 and up\n    Android 8 and up\n\nOlder versions of the Duo Mobile app will continue to work.\nSummary of changes\nThe following are some of the changes to the Duo Mobile app in version 4.0.\nNew Duo Approve screen\nIn versions prior to 4.0, the Approve button was on the left and the Deny button was on the right.  In Duo Mobile 4.0, the Approve button has been moved to the right, and the Deny button moved to the left.  Duo made this change to follow the industry standard of placing positive actions on the right (move forward in the flow of action), and negative actions on the left (move backward in the flow of action).\nThe interface has also been somewhat simplified and is now clearer on what you are being asked to approve.  Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the  Approve screen.\n \nThe screen that appears after you approve a Duo Push request has also changed and is now more obvious.  Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the screen that appears after you approve a Duo Push.\n\nNew Duo Home Screen\nThe Duo Home screen (what you see when you first open the app) has been redesigned.  Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the  Home screen.\n\n    There is no longer an \"Edit\" button for removing accounts\n    There is no longer an arrow pointing down for displaying the Duo Mobile-generated passcode. To display the Duo Mobile-generated passcode, simply tap on the University of Hawaii box.\n\n\n \n \nNew Duo Fraud screen\nWhen a Duo Push request is denied in version 3.x.x of the Duo Mobile app, you are asked if it was a fraudulent login attempt, or if you denied the request by mistake.  In Duo Mobile 4.0, this is simplified to a yes/no question of Was this a suspicious login?.  Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Duo Fraud screen.\n\nNew Duo Allow Notification screen \nIn version 3.x.x of Duo Mobile, when first setting up Duo Mobile, you are asked if you want to Allow Notifications with an alert similar to the alert show on the left side of the below graphic.  In Duo Mobile 4.0, you will now see a brief explanation of why you might want to allow notifications (i.e., to be able to authenticate from the phone's lock screen), and the prompt has also been simplified to an Allow or Skip answer.  Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Allow Notifications screen.\n\n \nNew Duo Allow Camera screen\nIn version 3.x.x of Duo Mobile, when first setting up Duo Mobile, you are asked if you wanted to Allow access to the camera with an alert similar to the alert show on the left side of the below graphic.  In Duo Mobile 4.0, you will now see a brief explanation of why  you would want to allow the camera (i.e. to be able to add a Duo MFA account via a QR code).  The Duo Mobile app will only access the camera while scanning a QR code to add an account, and will never access the device's photos.  Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Allow Camera screen.\n\nNew Android Notification screen\nIn Android notifications received in versions prior to 4.0, the word Approve was on the left and Deny was on the right.  In Duo Mobile 4.0, the word Approve has been moved to the right, and Deny moved to the left.   Duo made this change to follow the industry standard of placing positive  actions on the right (move forward in the flow of action), and negative  actions on the left (move backward in the flow of action).  The notification has also been modified to be clearer as to what you are being asked to approve; for example, the UH Login MFA Device Registration.  Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Android notification screen."

    "content": "Effective October 24, 2021\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted 988 as a new three-digit number to be used nationwide to reach the National Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Lifeline starting July 16, 2022. This will work similarly to dialing 911 to reach Emergency Services nation wide. \nIn order for 988 to work, 10-digit local dialing will be mandatory. Starting October 24, 2021, all local calls, including those on the same island, will require that you dial area code 808 + telephone number.\nWho is affected:\nAnyone with an area code 808 telephone number will need to make a change from 7-digit local dialing to 10-digit local dialing.\nHow does this affect UH:\n\n    On campus dialing (for example 5-digit extension dialing at Manoa, 4-digit extension dialing at Hawaii CC, KCC, UH Hilo, West Oahu and 3 digits at HCC, Kauai CC, LCC, Maui College, WCC ) will remain unchanged.  \n    9+7-digit dialing will still work from all UH campuses within the 808 prefix EXCEPT for calls to 808-988-xxxx (Manoa) which will require 9+10-digits. For consistency and to eliminate erroneous calls to the Lifeline, it is recommended that users adopt 9+10-digit dialing for all US numbers including to 9+808+telephone number from your campus phone. \n    Check with your alarm company to make necessary adjustments to any programmed 808 prefix number to dial to 9+808+telephone number.\n    Review the numbers stored in your fax machine and convert the stored numbers to 10-digits (9+808+telephone number). Refer to your fax machine guide for programming assistance.\n    Re-program your auto dial keys to 9+10-digits.  To change your auto dial:\n    \n        Click on the AutoDial key.\n        Enter 9+808+telephone number for all 808 prefix numbers\n        Press the AutoDial key to save.\n    \n    \n     To call forward your line:\n    \n        Press Forward\n        Enter 9+808+telephone number for all 808 prefix numbers\n        Press Forwar(d) to save\n    \n    \n    Change your Reach Me number to 808+telephone number.\n    Change your Notify me number to 808+telephone number.\n    Review your websites, letterheads, e-signatures, etc. for any 7-digit telephone number references and update them to 10-digits.   \n\nFor additional information:\nhttps://www.hawaiiantel.com/Residential/Support/Home-Phone-Support/Home-Phone-Support-Dial-808\nhttps://www.verizon.com/about/news/new-dialing-procedure-82-area-codes-36-states\n\nhttps://mobile.spectrum.com/support/article/360056951191/new-mandatory-10digit-dialing-procedures\nhttps://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/ten-digit-dialing\n \nIf you have any questions or concerns, please call ITS Telecommunications at 808-956-6033 or email us at telecom@hawaii.edu"

    "title": "Google@UH Storage Limitations and Quotas",
    "content": "In 2021, Google announced a new storage policy which will move our Google domain from unlimited storage to pooled storage across all Google@UH accounts by July 2024. This means that each Google@UH account’s use of Gmail, Drive, and Photos, in addition to all Google@UH shared drives, will collectively count towards our Google domain’s pooled storage. Should our collective storage use exceed our allotted pooled storage amount, some Google@UH services may be limited. In response to Google’s announcement, we looked at storage use for all Google@UH accounts and shared drives and identified some inappropriate use of the storage for Google@UH services.\n \nAs a result of Google’s change to pooled storage, as well as the discovery of some misuse of Google@UH resources, changes to Google@UH services will be made over the upcoming year to help manage the amount of our pooled storage being used.\n \nFrom Wednesday, February 1, 2023 to Monday, January 29, 2024, all Google@UH accounts will have storage quotas defined based on an individual’s affiliation with UH, with no service impact if the quota is reached or exceeded. This one-year non-enforcement period is being provided to allow individuals time to bring their Google@UH account and shared drive storage usage under the appropriate quota before Google@UH services become impacted.\n \nAfter Monday, January 29, 2024, storage quota enforcement will begin, with service impact for Google@UH accounts when the quota is reached or exceeded until storage use is brought back below the account quota.\n \n\n    Individual Google@UH account storage quotas\n    Google@UH Shared Drive limitations and storage quotas\n    FAQs\n\n\n \nIndividual Google@UH account storage quotas\nIndividual Google@UH accounts will have the following storage quota based on their affiliation/status. Quotas will be enforced starting on 1/29/2024. \n \n\n    \n        \n            Affiliation\n            Quota (in GB*)\n        \n        \n            Faculty / Emeritus Faculty\n            100 GB\n        \n        \n            Staff\n            100 GB\n        \n        \n            Students\n            25 GB\n        \n        \n            Prestudents\n            10 GB\n        \n        \n            Affiliates / Retirees\n            25 GB\n        \n        \n            Departmental/Organizational Usernames\n            25 GB\n        \n        \n            Ohana\n            7.5 GB\n        \n    \n\n *1GB = 1000MB\n \nUsers who have multiple affiliations will have storage quota based on whichever affiliation has the highest allocation. Storage quotas for these users will not be the sum of quotas for all of their affiliations. For example, a user who is both a faculty member and a student will have a storage quota based on their faculty affiliation (100 GB) as their faculty quota provides a higher allocation when compared with their student quota.\n \nGoogle@UH Shared Drive limitations and storage quotas\nAs of January 2023, Shared Drives created within Google Drive will have the following limitations and storage quotas.\n \n\n    Google@UH shared drives can only be created by UH faculty and staff using their Google@UH accounts. Other Google@UH account collaborators can continue to be granted an appropriate role within a shared drive, they just cannot request or create the shared drives themselves.\n    Newly created Google@UH shared drives have been limited to 25 GB of storage quota. Once this quota is reached, files within the shared drive will remain available, but new files will not be able to be stored in the shared drive.\n    Beginning on 4/1/2023, we will also be identifying and applying the same 25GB storage quota to existing shared drives that are well below this limit.\n\n \nFAQs\n\n    What counts towards my storage quota? \n    \n    How do I check my current storage use?\n    What happens if I exceed my storage quota?\n    \n     How do I manage my storage use by deleting emails, files, and photos?\n    \n     I deleted emails, files, or photos but I my storage use decreasing. Am I doing something wrong?\n    \n     I have emails, files, photos that I want to keep but I still need to lower my storage use. What options are available to me?\n     How do I request an exception to increase my quota?\n    I manage a Departmental or Organizational UH Username. Do these types of accounts have storage quotas?\n    Does the Shared Drive storage count against my individual storage quota?\n    How do I check the current storage usage of a Shared Drive?\n    How do I delete a Shared Drive?\n    Do Google Groups have storage quotas?\n\n\nWhat counts towards my storage quota?\nGmail\n\n    Messages and attachments including items in your Spam and Trash\n\nDrive\n\n    Most files in your \"My Drive,\" including PDFs, images, videos, and items in your Trash.\n    Files created or edited after May 2, 2022 in collaborative content creation apps like Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, Recorder, and Jamboard.\n\nGoogle Photos (available for users enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps)\n\n    Original quality photos and videos backed up to Google Photos.\n    \"High quality\" (now named \"Storage saver quality\") and \"Express quality\" photos and videos backed up to Google Photos after June 1, 2021.\n\n \nHow do I check my current storage use?\nYou can check your current storage usage by logging in at https://drive.google.com/drive/quota.\n \nWhat happens if I exceed my individual storage quota?\nDuring the non-enforcement period from 2/1/2023 to 1/29/2024 there will be no service impact if exceeding your individual storage quota. It is recommended that you use this time to review and reduce your storage usage to bring you under your quota.\nOnce enforcement begins after 1/29/2024 the following services will be impacted should you exceed your storage quota and will remain in place until your storage use falls below your quota:\n\n    You will not be able to upload new files or images to Google Drive.\n    You will not be able to create files in collaborative content creation apps, such as Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, and Jamboard. Until you reduce your storage usage, you will not be able to edit or copy affected files or submit forms.\n    You will not be able to back up any photos or videos to Google Photos.\n    You will not be able to record new meetings in Google Meet.\n    You will not be able to create assignments with new files, export grades to Google sheets, or make copies of Assignments in Google Classroom.\n\nThe following services will still be available to you even if you have exceeded your storage quota:\n\n    You will still be able to sign in.\n    You will still be able to send and receive emails.\n    You will still be able to view and download files stored on Google Drive.\n    You will still be able to view and download photos stored on Google Photos.\n\n \nHow do I manage my storage use by deleting emails, files, and photos?\nYou can find instructions and tips for finding and deleting emails, files, and photos that are taking up your storage here: https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/11448771.\nWhen managing your storage use, it is recommended to review items that are using the most amount of storage space first and work your way down to items using less storage space. Items that commonly utilize more storage space include large files (videos, music, software installers, etc.), high resolution or raw photos, docs/sheets/slides with images embedded, and emails with large attachments. In general, individual emails without attachments and small docs/sheets/slides without images utilize comparatively little storage space.\n \nI deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased. Am I doing something wrong?\nWhen you first delete an email, file, or photo it will be moved to the \"trash\". Emails, files, and photos in trash continue to count against your storage quota until permanently deleted. The Gmail, Drive, and Photos apps each have their own, individual trash. While in your trash, items can be recovered within 30 days. Items in trash are automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days. You can also choose to manually and permanently delete items in your trash at any time by navigating to the \"trash\" folder and clicking either \"Empty Trash\" to remove all items in trash or by selecting individual items and selecting \"Delete Forever\". \nPlease note that emails, files, and photos that are permanently deleted from trash are irrecoverable. This applies whether they were manually deleted from the trash or automatically deleted after the 30-day window. If you choose to manually delete emails, files, or photos from trash, please be absolutely certain that you no longer need them.\nIf you delete, restore, or permanently delete a large number of files or folders at once, it may take several minutes for the changes to be processed.\n \nI have emails, files, photos that I want to keep but I still need to lower my storage use. What options are available to me?\nYou can download a copy of emails, files, and photos prior to deleting them. Once you have a copy stored on your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account, you can delete the emails, files, or photos from your Google@UH account to free up storage space. Google Takeout offers an easy way to obtain a copy of Gmail, Drive, and Photo data (note, you must first be enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps to access Google Takeout).\nGmail\n\n    Google Takeout (available for users enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps)\n    Archive email via IMAP using Thunderbird\n\nDrive\n\n    Google Takeout (available for users enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps)\n    Download files from the web (https://drive.google.com/) to your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account\n    Use Google Drive for Desktop to copy/paste or drag/drop files to your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account\n\nPhotos\n\n    Google Takeout (available for users enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps)\n    Download files from the web (https://photos.google.com/) to your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account\n    Set up Partner Sharing to transfer Google Photos to a personal Google account. After setting up Partner Sharing, follow Google's instructions in the \"Save your partner's photos\" section to create a copy of photos in your personal account. Then, delete the photos from your hawaii.edu account. Remember, you need to empty your Google Photos' Trash in order to reclaim storage space used by deleted photos.\n\n \nHow do I request an exception to increase my storage quota?\nAs we are not yet enforcing storage quotas, we are not currently offering quota increases or exceptions. We will provide more information on how to request increases to your quota prior to enforcement. In the meantime, we strongly encourage users to use the non-enforcement period to review, evaluate, and shrink their storage usage. If you have any questions or concerns about your storage usage, please contact the ITS Help Desk.\n \nI manage a Departmental or Organizational UH Username. Do these types of accounts have storage quotas?\nYes, Departmental and Organizational UH Usernames have a 25 GB storage quota. See the individual Google@UH account storage quota table above for a full list of storage quotas by affiliation/status.\n \nDoes the Shared Drive storage count against my individual storage quota?\nNo, Shared Drives have their own storage quotas and storage used by a Shared Drive does not count towards an individual's storage quota. Storage used by Shared Drives does count towards our Google domain's total pooled storage limit. See below for information on reviewing the storage usage of a Shared Drive.\n \nHow do I check the current storage usage of a Shared Drive?\nFirst navigate to the list of Shared Drives that you manage or are a member of by visiting https://drive.google.com/drive/shared-drives. Next, click once to select the Shared Drive you'd like to check the storage usage of. After selecting a Shared Drive, click on the  \"View details\" icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. In the \"details pane\" that appears you will find a field named \"Storage used\" that will display the Shared Drive's current storage usage.\nWith the \"details pane\" open, you can click once to select and view the storage used by other Shared Drives that you manage or are a member of.  \nHow do I delete a Shared Drive?\nYou must have manager access and the shared drive has to be empty. (You must delete the files first or move them to \"my drive\")\n\n    On your computer, go to drive.google.com.\n    On the left, click Shared drives.\n    Right-click the shared drive you want to delete.\n    Click Delete shared drive.\n\nDo Google Groups have storage quotas?\nAt this time there is no storage quota for Google Groups and messages within the groups user interface do no count towards the domain's total pooled storage limit."

    "content": "Personal Quarantine\n    Quarantine Daily Digest\n    Quarantine Web Portal\n    Spam vs. Low Priority\n    Turning On Restrictive (Spam and Low Priority) Filtering\n    Accessing Your Personal Quarantine\n    Releasing Quarantined Email to Your Inbox\n    Safe Senders and Blocked Senders Lists\n    Adding Senders to Your Safe Senders List\n    Adding Senders to Your Blocked Senders List\n    Managing your Safe/Blocked Senders Lists\n    Requesting an On-Demand Quarantine Digest\n    Opting-Out of Receiving the Daily Digest\n    Personal Email Quarantine FAQs\n\nPersonal Quarantine\nProofpoint is the University's email security gateway, providing additional malware, phishing, spam, and targeted attack protection. Proofpoint automatically evaluates all incoming email and protects against spam, malware, phishing, spoofing, and enforces other content policies for the University. Email messages that are evaluated as spam will be delivered to a user’s personal quarantine for their review instead of being sent directly to their inbox. This personal quarantine serves as an additional layer of defense while still providing users with the control to manage the emails that Proofpoint is filtering. Each user/account has their own personal quarantine. Users will be notified of new messages in their personal quarantine via a daily digest sent by email. Users can also review messages in their personal quarantine at any time by visiting the quarantine web portal. Messages stored in a user’s personal quarantine will be automatically deleted after 30 days.\n \nNote: to better protect users, Proofpoint will block highly malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a user’s personal quarantine or inbox and, thus, users will be unable to interact with these more dangerous types of messages.\n \n\nQuarantine Daily Digest\nUsers will receive a daily digest that will provide a list of any new emails that have been placed in their personal quarantine within the last 24 hours. These daily digests will be delivered to users every day at 7:00 AM. Emails in a user’s personal quarantine are organized into spam or low priority (unsolicited invitations, newsletters, etc.) categories. From the emailed daily digest, users can review the sender, subject, and sent date/time of an email and can perform quick actions to release an email to their inbox or add a sender to their personal safe list. From the daily digest, users can also quickly pivot to the email quarantine web portal to further manage their personal quarantine.\n \n\nQuarantine Web Portal\nThe quarantine web portal provides users with additional tools to manage their quarantine. In the web portal, users can\n\n    view full email details including the body of a message,\n    view all emails still stored in their quarantine,\n    add or remove senders to or from their safe and block lists,\n    delete emails stored in their quarantine,\n    modify their daily digest preferences.\n     \n\n\nSpam vs. Low Priority\nQuarantined email in both the daily digest and web portal will be organized into two categories: Spam and Low Priority. In the daily digest, separate tables for Spam and Low Priority (with one email per row) will be presented to users. In the web portal, users will need to navigate between the Spam and Low Priority folders using the left-hand folder navigation menu.\nSpam\nSpam emails, sometimes referred to as “junk emails”, are unsolicited email messages. Often these messages are sent in bulk and will contain advertisements or will be commercial in nature. Spammers obtain email addresses from compromised websites or email lists, by harvesting compromised users’ address books, or by buying/trading address lists with other malicious actors. Some spam messages are not only annoying, but potentially harmful - used as a mechanism to direct users to malicious websites, broadly drop malicious programs or files as attachments, or con/scam users out of money.\nLow Priority\nLow Priority emails are often newsletters, invitations, or announcements from companies or services that users may have knowingly or unknowingly signed up for. Sometimes services that users sign up for may not inform users that they will be adding them to mailing lists or may share a user’s email address with other businesses without plainly stating it to users at the time of sign-up. What is considered wanted or unwanted low priority email may differ from user to user, so it may be prudent to more carefully review messages quarantined as low priority.\n \n\nTurning On Restrictive (Spam and Low Priority) Filtering\nBy default, only spam filtering is turned on. To also turn on \"low priority\" message filtering:\n\n    Access your personal quarantine.\n    Click on Profile (bottom left hand column). In My Settings, under What type of spam detection do you want?, select Restrictive to include \"low priority\" email message filtering.\n    Click Save.\n\n\n\n \n\nAccessing Your Personal Quarantine\nDaily Digest\nUsers will receive a daily digest to their inbox every day at 7:00 AM if there are any new emails in their personal quarantine. If there are no new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest was sent, users will not receive a scheduled daily digest. Users can also manually request an on-demand digest at any time by visiting any recent daily digest and clicking on the “Request On-Demand Quarantine Digest” link. The on-demand digest will show any new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest in addition to any emails currently stored in their personal quarantine.\nWeb Portal\nUsers can access their personal quarantine web portal by visiting quarantine.hawaii.edu (available after Proofpoint's implementation on 5/22/2023). Users can also pivot to the web portal from any daily digest by clicking on the “Manage My Quarantine (Quarantine Web Portal)” link, or by clicking the Proofpoint icon in their Google App Drawer .\n\t\t\n\n Releasing Quarantined Email to Your Inbox\nDaily Digest\nTo release quarantined items from your daily digest to your inbox, click on the “Release” link under the “Action” column next to the email you want to release. Repeat this process for any other emails in your daily digest that you wish to release. Optionally, you can also click “Release and Allow Sender” to release the quarantined email to your inbox and allow all future emails from the sender to bypass your personal quarantine. \n \n\nWeb Portal\nTo release quarantined items from the Web Portal, tick the checkbox next to an email or multiple emails that you want to release to your inbox, then click “Release” in the toolbar. You can also click into an individual email to view additional details and then click “Release” in the toolbar. Optionally, you can click “Release and Allow Sender” to release selected quarantine emails to your inbox and allow all future emails from those sender(s) to bypass your personal quarantine.\n \n\n \n\nSafe Senders and Blocked Senders Lists\nAdding senders to your safe senders list allows all future email sent from an address to bypass your personal quarantine and flow directly into your inbox regardless of whether Proofpoint evaluates the email as spam or low priority. This is useful if you trust all emails coming from a particular source and their emails sometimes end up in your personal quarantine.\n \nAdding senders to your blocked list causes all future email sent from an address to always filter into your personal quarantine and never flow directly into your inbox. This is useful if you would like to block all future emails coming from a particular source.\n \n\nAdding Senders to Your Safe Senders List\nDaily Digest\nTo add senders to your safe senders list from your daily digest, click on the “Release and Allow Sender” link under the “Action” column next to the email sent by the address you wish to safe list. This will release the email to your inbox and add the sender to your safe senders list. Repeat this process for any other emails in your daily digest with different senders that you wish to safe list.\n \n\nWeb Portal\nTo add senders to your safe senders list from the web portal, tick the checkbox next to an email or multiple emails sent by addresses you wish to safe list, then click “Allow Sender” in the toolbar. You can also click into an individual email to view additional details and then click “Allow Sender” in the toolbar. Optionally, you can click “Release and Allow Sender” to both release the selected quarantine emails to your inbox and allow all future emails from those sender(s) to bypass your personal quarantine.\n \n\n \n\nAdding Senders to Your Blocked Senders List\nDaily Digest\nAdding senders to your blocked senders list is currently not available using the daily digest. You will need to use the web portal, instead.\nWeb Portal\nTo add senders to your blocked senders list from the web portal, tick the checkbox next to an email or multiple emails sent by addresses you wish to block list, then click “Block Sender” in the toolbar. You can also click into an individual email to view additional details and then click “Block Sender” in the toolbar.\n \n\n \n\nManaging your Safe/Blocked Senders Lists\nYour safe and blocked senders lists can be managed in the web portal. Actions available include adding new entries, editing existing entries, or deleting existing entries.\nDaily Digest\nManaging your safe/blocked senders lists is currently not available using the daily digest. You will need to use the web portal, instead.\nWeb Portal\nTo manage your safe/blocked senders lists from the web portal, click on “Lists” in the lower left-hand corner. In the left-hand navigation menu select the list you’d like to manage - either “Safe Senders List” or “Blocked Senders List”. From here you will see a list of all entries in your selected list. To add a new entry, click \"New\" from the toolbar. To edit an existing entry, tick the checkbox next to the entry you wish to edit then select \"Edit\" from the toolbar. To delete an existing entry, tick the checkbox next to the entry you wish to edit then select \"Delete\" from the toolbar.\n \nNote: removing an entry from your blocked list will not guarantee that the sender’s email will always be delivered to your inbox - their email will still be evaluated and potentially filtered into your personal quarantine unless you specifically add them to your safe list. Similarly, removing an entry from your safe list will not guarantee that the sender’s email will always be filtered into your personal quarantine - their email will still be evaluated and potentially allowed to flow to your inbox.\n \n\nRequesting an On-Demand Quarantine Digest\nYou can request an on-demand digest at any time to see an up-to-date list of emails contained in your personal quarantine. Note that, unlike the automated daily digests which only show emails that arrived in your personal quarantine since the last daily digest was sent, on-demand digests will list the latest (chronological) emails in your personal quarantine.\nDaily Digest\nFrom any daily digest email, click on the “Request On-Demand Quarantine Digest” link.\nWeb Portal\nFrom the web portal, select “Options” from the toolbar, then “Request Digest”.\n \n\nOpting-Out of Receiving the Daily Digest\nFrom the web portal, click “Profile” in the lower left-hand corner. Next, uncheck “Send digest with new messages in my Email Quarantine Daily Digest” option, then click “Save”.\n \nYou can opt back in at any time by returning to the web portal and checking that option again.\n \n\n \n\nPersonal Email Quarantine FAQs\n\nHow long are emails stored in my personal quarantine?\nEmail is stored for 30 days in your personal quarantine. Any email older than 30 days is automatically deleted.\nWhat if I want to keep an email for longer than 30 days?\nIt is recommended that you release any emails that you’d like to store longer-term to your inbox.\nI didn’t get a daily digest today. Why is that?\nYou will only receive a daily digest if new emails have been filtered to your personal quarantine since the last time you received a digest.\nDo I need to take any action on messages in my personal quarantine?\nIt is recommended to review your daily digests for email that you want to release to your inbox. As email in your personal quarantine will be deleted after 30 days, you have a limited window within which you can review and release emails in your quarantine.\n \nFor email that you do not want to release, no further action is required on your part. Email can simply remain in your quarantine until they are deleted after 30 days.\nDo I need to delete email in my personal quarantine?\nNo, email will be automatically deleted after 30 days. You do not need to manually delete email in your personal quarantine.\nCan I change the time at which I receive my daily digest?\nUnfortunately, no. Users cannot specify at which time they will receive the scheduled daily digests. Digests are currently scheduled to be sent at 7:00 AM daily. Alternatively, users can request an on-demand digest at any time or visit the web portal to review their personal quarantine at any time.\nI can’t find a message in my personal quarantine. Where did it go?\nEmails are only stored in your personal quarantine for 30 days. If the email you’re looking for is older than 30 days, it will have been deleted.\n \nIf you had already released an email from your personal quarantine, you will find it in your inbox or possibly other folders/labels at your Google@UH Gmail (remember, any filters you have configured within your Google@UH gmail will still trigger on matched email released from your quarantine).\n \nIf you have many messages in your quarantine and are having trouble finding what you're looking for, try searching your quarantine for the sender or a part of the subject by clicking “Find” in the toolbar of the web portal.\nWill I see all filtered messages in my personal quarantine?\nAll spam and low priority email quarantined within the last 30 days will be visible in your personal quarantine.\n \nTo better protect users, proofpoint will block more dangerous or malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a user’s personal quarantine or inbox and thus users will be unable to view or interact with these types of messages.\nHow do I identify my daily digest?\nYou will receive your daily digest every morning at 7:00 AM. Other details of the daily digest are as follows:\n \nfrom: Email Quarantine Daily Digest <noreply@hawaii.edu>\nto: yourusername@hawaii.edu\nsubject: Email Quarantine Daily Digest: X Total Messages (‘X’ representing the number of new messages that have been quarantined since the last daily digest was sent)\nWhat’s the difference between the “Release” and “Release and Allow Sender” actions?\n“Release” will release a message from your quarantine to your inbox. “Release and Allow Sender” will both release a message to your inbox and add the sender of the email to your safe senders list, allowing all future email from that sender to bypass your personal quarantine and always arrive in your inbox.\n \nWhat's the difference between my personal quarantine and my gmail 'Spam' folder?\nIn concept, the two are very similar. However, Proofpoint's personal quarantine adds an additional layer of defense by safely allowing users to review messages before they arrive in their inbox. This can help prevent accidental clicks on advertisements or attachments, the loading of tracking cookies/images, and unintentionally providing data on your activity to third parties."

Proofpoint automatically evaluates all incoming email and protects against spam, malware, phishing, spoofing, and enforces other content policies for the University. Email messages that are evaluated as spam will be delivered to a user’s personal quarantine for their review instead of being sent directly to their inbox. This personal quarantine serves as an additional layer of defense while still providing users with the control to manage the emails that Proofpoint is filtering. Each user/account has their own personal quarantine. Users will be notified of new messages in their personal quarantine via a daily digest sent by email. Users can also review messages in their personal quarantine at any time by visiting the quarantine web portal. Messages stored in a user’s personal quarantine will be automatically deleted after 30 days.\n \nNote: to better protect users, Proofpoint will block highly malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a user’s personal quarantine or inbox and, thus, users will be unable to interact with these more dangerous types of messages.\n \n\nQuarantine Daily Digest\nUsers will receive a daily digest that will provide a list of any new emails that have been placed in their personal quarantine within the last 24 hours. These daily digests will be delivered to users every day at 7:00 AM. Emails in a user’s personal quarantine are organized into spam or low priority (unsolicited invitations, newsletters, etc.) categories. From the emailed daily digest, users can review the sender, subject, and sent date/time of an email and can perform quick actions to release an email to their inbox or add a sender to their personal safe list. From the daily digest, users can also quickly pivot to the email quarantine web portal to further manage their personal quarantine.\n \n\nQuarantine Web Portal\nThe quarantine web portal provides users with additional tools to manage their quarantine. In the web portal, users can\n\n    view full email details including the body of a message,\n    view all emails still stored in their quarantine,\n    add or remove senders to or from their safe and block lists,\n    delete emails stored in their quarantine,\n    modify their daily digest preferences.\n     \n\n\nSpam vs. Low Priority\nQuarantined email in both the daily digest and web portal will be organized into two categories: Spam and Low Priority. In the daily digest, separate tables for Spam and Low Priority (with one email per row) will be presented to users. In the web portal, users will need to navigate between the Spam and Low Priority folders using the left-hand folder navigation menu.\nSpam\nSpam emails, sometimes referred to as “junk emails”, are unsolicited email messages. Often these messages are sent in bulk and will contain advertisements or will be commercial in nature. Spammers obtain email addresses from compromised websites or email lists, by harvesting compromised users’ address books, or by buying/trading address lists with other malicious actors. Some spam messages are not only annoying, but potentially harmful - used as a mechanism to direct users to malicious websites, broadly drop malicious programs or files as attachments, or con/scam users out of money.\nLow Priority\nLow Priority emails are often newsletters, invitations, or announcements from companies or services that users may have knowingly or unknowingly signed up for. Sometimes services that users sign up for may not inform users that they will be adding them to mailing lists or may share a user’s email address with other businesses without plainly stating it to users at the time of sign-up. What is considered wanted or unwanted low priority email may differ from user to user, so it may be prudent to more carefully review messages quarantined as low priority.\n \n\nTurning On Restrictive (Spam and Low Priority) Filtering\nBy default, only spam filtering is turned on. To also turn on \"low priority\" message filtering:\n\n    Access your personal quarantine.\n    Click on Profile (bottom left hand column). In My Settings, under What type of spam detection do you want?, select Restrictive to include \"low priority\" email message filtering.\n    Click Save.\n\n\n\n \n\nAccessing Your Personal Quarantine\nDaily Digest\nUsers will receive a daily digest to their inbox every day at 7:00 AM if there are any new emails in their personal quarantine. If there are no new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest was sent, users will not receive a scheduled daily digest. Users can also manually request an on-demand digest at any time by visiting any recent daily digest and clicking on the “Request On-Demand Quarantine Digest” link. The on-demand digest will show any new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest in addition to any emails currently stored in their personal quarantine.\nWeb Portal\nUsers can access their personal quarantine web portal by visiting quarantine.hawaii.edu (available after Proofpoint's implementation on 5/22/2023). Users can also pivot to the web portal from any daily digest by clicking on the “Manage My Quarantine (Quarantine Web Portal)” link, or by clicking the Proofpoint icon in their Google App Drawer .\n\t\t\n\n Releasing Quarantined Email to Your Inbox\nDaily Digest\nTo release quarantined items from your daily digest to your inbox, click on the “Release” link under the “Action” column next to the email you want to release.

One of the security features provided by Proofpoint is called URL Defense. URL Defense works by rewriting URLs (web addresses and links) in emails as they pass through our Proofpoint gateway on their way to your inbox. By rewriting URLs, Proofpoint is able to send all “clicks” of a URL to an isolated sandbox and scan the destination website to ensure it’s safe before you visit.\n\nHow does URL Defense work?\nEmail-based attacks, especially phishing attacks, are often triggered when users click on malicious links (URLs) provided to them in email. Malicious actors often try to imitate the URLs of legitimate websites or hide malicious URLs behind shortened URLs to obfuscate the actual website users will visit upon clicking. The malicious website may closely resemble a login page the user is accustomed to in an attempt to fool even the most vigilant of users into logging in, thereby exposing their credentials and providing the malicious actor with an avenue into the user’s email or other systems. The malicious website may have been developed with the intent to exploit browser or OS vulnerabilities and infect the user’s device with ransomware, cryptojacks, or other malware. Once infected, malware often scans local networks, hunting for other devices vulnerable to infection - sometimes lying dormant on host devices for hours, days, or weeks to prevent detection - before initializing and executing its attack.\nThis all starts with clicking a link sent via email. URL Defense works by rewriting URLs before they reach your inbox. When a rewritten URL is clicked, URL Defense will open the destination website in a remote sandbox in order to safely scan the website before your visit. If a website is determined to be safe, URL Defense will seamlessly forward you along to the destination website. If the website is determined to be malicious, URL Defense will not send you to the website and will instead display a message to inform you that the site has been blocked and why.\n\nWhat do rewritten URLs look like?\nIn the email body text, a rewritten URL will appear no different from when it was sent. However, when hovering over or inspecting URLs, you will notice that rewritten URLs begin with https://urldefense.com/… or https://urldefense.proofpointcom/… This is normal and is an indication that URL Defense will be used to scan the website before your visit.\n\nAre all URLs sent in email rewritten?\nNo, the following URLs will not be rewritten:\n\n    URLs sent internally (from @hawaii.edu to @hawaii.edu)\n    URLs that link to known-safe domains or websites\n    URLs that link to services provided by Proofpoint (proofpoint.com, pphosted.com, urldefense.com, urldefense.proofpoint.com)\n\n\nHow long does URL Defense take to scan a website before sending me to the website?\nThe process to sandbox and scan the website usually takes no longer than a few moments and the delay is often unnoticeable.\n\nDo I need to be using a certain device or email client for URL Defense to work?\nNo, URL Defense is device and network-agnostic. URL Defense will work to protect you whether you are using Google@UH Gmail on the web, a mail client like Outlook or Thunderbird, or checking your email on your mobile device.\n\nWhat if the malicious actor changes the website after the email is delivered to me?\n“Delayed phishing” or “post-delivery weaponization” is a process where a malicious actor initially sends an email with a link that routes to a harmless website, then later weaponizes the link by redirecting to a malicious site or replacing the harmless website content with malicious content. This is effective in fooling some email protection methods that only scan websites upon email delivery, leaving users who view the email after the link has been weaponized vulnerable.\nConversely, URL Defense performs its scans of websites when a link is clicked by a user and thus is still effective in blocking delayed phishing attacks. Regardless of if or when a destination website changes, URL Defense will always scan the website you’re about to visit.\n\nWhat if a website I visited was identified as malicious and blocked by Proofpoint?\nIf URL Defense identifies the website you’re about to visit as malicious it will send you to an informational page explaining that the website was blocked and why. You will not be directed to the destination website. Blocked pages are automatically reported for analysis and no further action is needed on your part."

Regardless of if or when a destination website changes, URL Defense will always scan the website you’re about to visit.\n\nWhat if a website I visited was identified as malicious and blocked by Proofpoint?\nIf URL Defense identifies the website you’re about to visit as malicious it will send you to an informational page explaining that the website was blocked and why. You will not be directed to the destination website. Blocked pages are automatically reported for analysis and no further action is needed on your part."

    "title": "Departmental Website phpCAS upgrade",
    "content": "If your PHP application hosted by the UH Departmental Hosted Website Service is using the server provided library phpCAS, a major vulnerability was reported in recent months requiring an update.  We have tenatitvely scheduled the update for Monday, July 10, 2023 at 9:00am.\n \nThe unfortunate part of the security update is that the parameters in the call to initialize phpCAS (phpCAS::client) are different and incompatible with the parameters used in the previous versions.  Because of this you'll need two different initialization calls in your code, one to be used up until phpCAS is upgraded, and one to be used after the upgrade.\n \nHere's some code you can use to update your application:  (code additions are shown in bold) \n\nif (version_compare(phpCAS::getVersion(), '1.6.0', '<')) \n   phpCAS::client( CAS_VERSION_2_0, $cas_host, $cas_port, $cas_context ); \nelse\n   phpCAS::client( CAS_VERSION_2_0, $cas_host, $cas_port, $cas_context, 'https://www.hawaii.edu' );\n\n\nThis code checks the version of phpCAS being used.  If older than version 1.6.0, it runs the original phpCAS::client line.  If version 1.6.0 or newer, it adds the client service name as the final parameter.  The URL used in this parameter (above, 'https://www.hawaii.edu') has the protocol, domain, and port of the page calling the function.  So for example, if your website is hosted at https://manoa.hawaii.edu/mysite/, the client service name should be:  'https://manoa.hawaii.edu'.\n \nTo help you test your site against the new phpCAS library, we have setup test servers where your live php code is using the updated phpCAS library.  Finally if you have any questions about the phpCAS upgrade, please contact web support at web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu\n \n\nSetting up your computer to test the new version of phpCAS\nThe first step is to point your computer's hosts file to the test webserver directly.  This is accomplished differently depending on which Operating System you are using.\nWindows Setup\nMac Setup\nLinux Setup\nWindows Setup\nOpen your favorite text editor such as Notepad as an administrator (right-click, run as administrator).\nFrom your text editor, open up your computer's hosts file.  You will find your hosts file here: %systemroot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts  (%systemroot% is usually c:\\windows\\ but may be somewhere else if your Windows was set up differently.)\nIf your website is hosted on one of the domains shown below, add the line as shown.  If not, please contact web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu with your domain name and we will

uhcc.hawaii.edu\nSave the file (for Notepad: from the menu, File -> Save or ctrl+s), and when you open your browser to your website, it will now point to the test webservers running the newest version of phpCAS.\n \nYou can test compatibility by going to your website, and doing what you regularly do on your website and seeing if any errors arise.  If everything works fine, you're all set.\n \nAfter you complete testing, remember to remove the line from your hosts file that you added in step three to have your browsers point back to the production websites.\nMac Setup\nOpen your Terminal app. For most users, this  is under Applications Folder -> Utilities Folder\nIn Terminal, your first step is to open your hosts file with your console's text editor as Super User.  This can be done by typing the following into the Terminal app: sudo nano /private/etc/hosts\nNext, you will need to update your hosts file by adding your website's domain to it.  If your website is hosted on one of the domains shown below, add the line as shown.  If not, please contact web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu with your domain name and we will let you know what your line should be.\n128.171.149.219

    "title": "'Ohana Google@UH Storage Policy and Quotas",
    "content": "This AskUs article applies specifically to Google@UH Storage Limitations and Quotas for our 'Ohana users (users who are no longer active students, staff, faculty, or other affiliates). If you are an active student, staff, faculty, or affiliate, please visit https://hawaii.edu/askus/1882 for relevant information on your Google@UH Storage Limitations and Quotas.\n \nIn 2021, Google announced a new storage policy which will move our Google domain from unlimited storage to pooled storage across all Google@UH accounts. This means that each Google@UH account’s use of Gmail, Drive, and Photos, in addition to all Google@UH shared drives, will collectively count towards our Google domain’s pooled storage. Should our collective storage use exceed our allotted pooled storage amount, some Google@UH services may be limited. In response to Google’s announcement, we reviewed storage use for all Google@UH accounts and shared drives and identified some inappropriate use of the storage for Google@UH services.\n \nAs a result of Google’s change to pooled storage, as well as the discovery of some misuse of Google@UH resources, storage quotas are being instituted for all Google@UH accounts based on an individual’s affiliation with UH.\n \n'Ohana user accounts (those users who are no longer an active student, staff, faculty, or other affiliate) will have a 7.5 GB storage quota.\n \nOn Monday, January 29, 2024, storage quotas will start being enforced, with service impact for ‘Ohana user accounts whose storage usage exceeds their 7.5 GB storage quota. Ohana users over their quota after enforcement begins may have their UH Username disabled and all data stored within their Google@UH account deleted (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contacts data, etc.). We are notifying ‘Ohana users in advance of this change to provide impacted users with time to bring their Google@UH storage usage within their 7.5 GB storage quota before enforcement begins.\n \nFAQs\n\n    Can I keep my UH username?\n    As 'Ohana, what is my storage quota?\n    How long will I have to reduce my storage usage and bring my usage within my allotted 7.5 GB quota?\n    What counts towards my storage quota? \n    \n    How do I check my current storage use?\n    What happens if I exceed my storage quota?\n    \n     How do I manage my storage use by deleting emails, files, and photos?\n    \n     I deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased.

To find your grace period's end date, please review the email(s) that were sent to you upon entering your grace period titled \"Important Notice - End of access to UH Online Services\" or \"Confirmation of your UH Ohana request\" (for users who had pre-opted into Ohana).\n \nWhat counts towards my storage quota?\nGmail\n\n    Messages and attachments including items in your Spam and Trash\n\nDrive\n\n    Most files in your \"My Drive,\" including PDFs, images, videos, and items in your Trash.\n    Files created or edited after May 2, 2022 in collaborative content creation apps like Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, Recorder, and Jamboard.\n\nGoogle Photos (available for users enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps)\n\n    Original quality photos and videos backed up to Google Photos.\n    \"High quality\" (now named \"Storage saver quality\") and \"Express quality\" photos and videos backed up to Google Photos after June 1, 2021.\n\n \nHow do I check my current storage use?\nYou can check your current storage usage by logging in at https://drive.google.com/drive/quota.\n \nWhat happens if I exceed my individual storage quota?\nPrior to enforcement beginning on 1/29/2024\nPrior to 1/29/2024 there will be no service impact if exceeding your individual storage quota. It is recommended that you use this time to review and reduce your storage usage to bring your usage under your 7.5 GB quota.\nOnce enforcement begins after 1/29/2024\n'Ohana users within their 180-day grace period will see the following impact should their storage quota be exceeded:\n\n    You will not be able to upload new files or images to Google Drive.\n    You will not be able to create files in collaborative content creation apps, such as Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, and Jamboard. Until you reduce your storage usage, you will not be able to edit or copy affected files or submit forms.\n    You will not be able to back up any photos or videos to Google Photos.\n    You will not be able to record new meetings in Google Meet.\n    You will not be able to create assignments with new files, export grades to Google sheets, or make copies of Assignments in Google Classroom.\n    \n\n\n    You will still be able to sign in.\n    You will still be able to send and receive emails.\n    You will still be able to view and download files stored on Google Drive.\n    You will still be able to view and download photos stored on Google Photos.\n\n'Ohana users who are no longer within their 180-day grace period may have their UH Usernames disabled and all data stored within their Google@UH accounts deleted (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contacts data, etc.).\n \nHow do I manage my storage use by deleting emails, files, and photos?\nYou can find instructions and tips for finding and deleting emails, files, and photos that are taking up your storage here: https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/11448771.\nWhen managing your storage use, it is recommended to review items that are using the most amount of storage space first and work your way down to items using less storage space. Items that commonly utilize more storage space include large files (videos, music, software installers, etc.), high resolution or raw photos, docs/sheets/slides with images embedded, and emails with large attachments. In general, individual emails without attachments and small docs/sheets/slides without images utilize comparatively little storage space.\n \nI deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased. Am I doing something wrong?\nWhen you first delete an email, file, or photo it will be moved to the \"trash\". Gmail, Drive, and Photos all have their own trash. Emails, files, or photos in trash still count against your storage use. Storage in use by items in trash will be reclaimed once the items are permanently deleted. Items in trash are automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days. While in your trash, items can be recovered before the 30-day time window. You can also choose to manually and permanently delete items in your trash at any time by navigating to the \"trash\" folder and clicking either \"Empty Trash\" to remove all items in trash or by selecting individual items and selecting \"Delete Forever\". \nPlease note that emails, files, and photos that are permanently deleted from trash are irrecoverable. This applies whether they were manually deleted from the trash or automatically deleted after the 30-day time window. If you choose to manually delete emails, files, or photos from trash, please be absolutely certain that you no longer need them.\nIf you delete, restore, or permanently delete a large number of files or folders at once, it might take time for the changes to be processed.\n \nI have emails, files, photos that I want to keep but I still need to lower my storage use. What options are available to me?\nYou can download a copy of emails, files, and photos prior to deleting them. Once you have a copy stored on your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account you can delete the emails, files, or photos from your Google@UH account to free up storage space. Google Takeout offers an easy way to obtain a copy of Gmail, Drive, and Photo data but you must be enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps to access Takeout.\nGmail\n\n    Google Takeout (available for users enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps)\n    Archive email via IMAP using Thunderbird\n\nDrive\n\n    Google Takeout (available for users enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps)\n    Download files from the web (https://drive.google.com/) to your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account\n    Use Google Drive for Desktop to copy/paste or drag/drop files to your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account\n\nPhotos\n\n    Google Takeout (available for users enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps)\n    Download files from the web (https://photos.google.com/) to your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account\n    Set up Partner Sharing to transfer Google Photos to a personal Google account. After setting up Partner Sharing, follow Google's instructions in the \"Save your partner's photos\" section to create a copy of photos in your personal account. Then, delete the photos from your hawaii.edu account. Remember, you need to empty your Google Photos' Trash in order to reclaim storage space used by deleted photos.\n\n \nCan I transfer my data directly to a personal Google account?\nYou can transfer emails from Gmail and most Drive files to a personal Google account using Google Takeout Transfer. One benefit of transfering data to a personal Google account is that Google offers personal @gmail.com users 15 GB of storage for free. Doubling the storage allotted to your Google@UH account.\nIf you plan to use Google Takeout Transfer, keep in mind the following:\n\n    You will need to enroll in Google@UH Consumer Apps\n    You may need to purchase a Google One plan if you need storage beyond the 15 GB provided with to a free personal Google account.\n    After the transfer is complete you will still need to delete data from your Google@UH account in order to reduce your storage use.\n\nRefer to the Google guide Copy content from your school account to another account for detailed instructions on performing the Takeout Transfer.\nNote, you cannot directly transfer Google Photos to a personal Google account using Takeout Transfer. Instead, refer to one of the options listed above to transfer photos: use Takeout to download a copy of Photos, download Photos directly from the web, or set up Partner Sharing.\n \nDoes Shared Drive storage count against my individual storage quota?\nNo, Shared Drives have their own storage quotas and storage used by a Shared Drive does not count towards an individual's storage quota. Storage used by Shared Drives does, however, count towards our Google domain's total pooled storage limit. See below for information on changing the manager of a Shared Drive.\n'Ohana users (and those in the 180 day grace period) who are managers of a Shared Drive should transfer managership of Shared Drive to an active faculty, staff, student, or other affiliate, as Shared Drives that are not managed by an active faculty, staff, student, or other affiliate may be deleted.\nHow do I delete a Shared Drive?\nYou must have manager access and the shared drive has to be empty. (You must delete the files first or move them to \"my drive\")\n\n    On your computer, go to drive.google.com.\n    On the left, click Shared drives.\n    Right-click the shared drive you want to delete.\n    Click Delete shared drive.\n\n \nHow do I transfer manager of a Shared Drive?\nFirst navigate to the list of Shared Drives that you manage or are a member of by visiting https://drive.google.com/drive/shared-drives. Next, click once to select the Shared Drive you'd like to check the membership of. After selecting a Shared Drive, click on the  \"View details\" icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. In the \"details pane\" that appears click on \"Manage access\" to view the membership of the Shared Drive.\nFor each drive you are a Manager of, add a new manager by entering their email address in the \"Add people and groups\" and clicking on the email address. Use the drop down box to select the Manager role and optionally enter a Message. Click on Send to complete the process."

    "content": "The US Department of Education Federal Student Aid Office has notified higher education institutions that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) amended their Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information (Safeguards Rule) component of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).  \nAs part of these amended GLBA requirements, and to safeguard personal information of consumers, UH Information Technology Services (ITS) will be requiring all active students, faculty and staff to enroll in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in order to access the University's online services (e.g., Google@UH, STAR, Laulima, MyUH, etc.). This requirement will go into effect on October 2, 2023.\nThe new GLBA requirements are beneficial. UH has been experiencing ongoing brute force and credential stuffing attacks by cyber criminals attempting to gain access to UH usernames. Since January 1, 2023 we have averaged 20.5 attacks a month, resulting in over 52,000 login attempts in which over 49,000 users have been targeted that resulted in 35 successful logins.

What is Duo?\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides a layered approach to secure access to online accounts by requiring a user to present two (or more) distinct identifying \"factors\" before access is granted to the account or online resource. The first factor is commonly referred to as \"something you know\". At UH, this \"something you know\" would be your normal UH Login credentials (UH Username and password). This \"something you know\" username and password combination has been the most common method for authentication in the industry for decades, but has significant security weaknesses: used as the sole factor for authentication, this method is susceptible to brute force, credential stuffing, and phishing attacks and should a user's credentials be compromised, would allow immediate access to an attacker.\nMulti-Factor Authentication helps protect against these common types of attacks by also requiring a second factor, commonly referred to as \"something you have\", at login. This \"something you have\" is routinely something you possess - a mobile phone, tablet, landline, or physical token. When using MFA, a user will be asked for both their first factor and second factor before access is granted to the account or online resource. Confirmation that you are in possession of your second factor device and are permitting a log in is normally accomplished by requiring active interaction with the device (responding to a push notificiation on your smartphone or entering a passcode that was recieved via SMS, etc.). \nAs an example, consider that you've been using Multi-Factor Authentication each and every time you withdraw cash at an ATM. First, you present your debit card (\"something you have\") to the ATM. Next, you are asked to input your PIN (\"something you know\"). If either factor cannot be provided, access to your account is not granted and your money cannot be withdrawn. This makes it more difficult for a bad actor who has stolen your wallet (and thus only has one factor) from being able to withdraw your money from an ATM. You may also already be familiar with MFA as its use has become more widespread and ubiquitous for many online services from social media to online banking to gaming and entertainment.\nDuo is the service that UH (and many other higher-ed institutions) uses to provide Multi-Factor Authentication. Duo provides a mature platform with several second factor methods and integrates seamlessly with UH Login.\nAm I required to enroll in MFA?\nAll active Faculty, Staff, Students, Prestudents, Affiliates (Including Postdocs), and Emeritus are required to enroll in MFA.\nFormer students/alumnus, former faculty/staff, and retirees are not required to enroll in MFA, but may elect to enroll in MFA. However, once enrolled, there is no option to opt-out.\nDepartmental and Organizational UH Username are not required to enroll in MFA, but owners of these types of accounts may elect to enroll the account in MFA to help increase security. \nSEED (Na Kapuna) participants are not required to enroll in Duo MFA.\nRefer to Affected Users above to view this information in table format. \nHow do I check if I am already enrolled in MFA?\nTo check if you are enrolled in MFA, please go to the Device Registration Page.\nNot enrolled\nIf you have not yet enrolled in MFA, you will see a prompt to \"Protect Your University of Hawaii Account\" with a \"Start setup\" button present. At this point, you can begin your enrollment by clicking on \"Start Setup\". Please visit the the following AskUs article for step-by-step instructions on setting up your first device: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681.\n\nEnrolled\nIf you are already enrolled in MFA, you will see a prompt to test your existing second-factor authentication device(s). If you'd like to add a new second-factor device or adjust your devices and settings, you can do so by selecting \"Add a new device\" or \"My Settings & Devices\" from the left-hand menu. Otherwise, you can close your browser tab or window after confirming your enrollment.\n\nIf you require any assistance determining if you are enrolled in MFA, please contact the ITS Help Desk.\nHow do I enroll in MFA?\nTo begin enrollment, please visit the the Device Registration Page. For instructions on enrolling in Duo MFA, refer to our \"Getting setup for Multi-Factor Authentication\" article.\n*Note that several authentication methods are listed in the first section which you can select per your preference. ITS recommends Duo Push through the Duo Mobile app. It is also strongly recommended that you register at least two devices for MFA. By registering two devices, if one of your devices becomes unavailable (e.g if your phone is forgotten or lost), you still have another option to use for authentication.\nIf you require any assistance enrolling in MFA, please contact the ITS Help Desk.\nWhat happens if I don't enroll in MFA by October 2, 2023?\nUsers who are required to enroll in Duo MFA but fail to do so by the October 2, 2023 deadline will be routed to the Duo MFA enrollment page upon their next login. UH online services that require authentication via UH Login will be inaccessible until users complete their MFA enrollment.\nUH online services that will be inaccessible should users fail to enroll in Duo MFA include, but are not limited to, Laulima, Google@UH apps (including Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc.), UH Username Management, Financial aid information, Student Employment, Kuali Financial System, Banner, UH Enterprise Dropbox, Peoplesoft, TAPS, eTravel, and Leave.\nWhat methods can I use to authenticate? What options are avaialble to use as my second factor(s)?\nUH Login supports for the following MFA methods and second factor devices:\n\n    Duo Push, using the Duo Mobile app on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet)\n    Duo Passcode, using the Duo Mobile app on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet)\n    Phone Call, using either a mobile phone or landline\n    SMS Passcodes, using a mobile phone that supports SMS (text messaging)\n    Yubikey Hard Token, which is inserted into your computer's USB port\n\nITS highly recommends Duo Push as the primary method when authenticating. We also highly recommend that users configure at least two (2) second factor devices. In this way, should a user forget or lose one of their factors (smartphone, for example), they will have an additional method to use to authenticate (landline or tablet, for example). Users can configure multiple second factor devices.\nFor more information on the different methods you can use and the requirements and considerations for each method, please refer to our \"Which authentication method should I use?\" article.\nWhat if I am unable to or don't want to enroll in MFA using my smartphone as my second factor?\nWhile ITS highly recommends the use of Duo Push via the Duo Mobile app, there are other methods available to those who do not own a smartphone, such as registering an iOS or Android tablet, registering a hard token, or registering a landline or non-smartphone and authenticating via phone call or SMS.\nOption 1: Landline\nFor individuals without access to a smartphone, you can authenticate logins by using the Call Me option on a landline at home phone or office phone. To see how to setup this method, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#landline2.\nOption 2: Tablet\nFor individuals with a tablet or other smart device without a phone plan, as long as your device has internet connection you can authenticate through the Duo Mobile app by using the Push method. Once the Duo Mobile app is installed and setup, authentication can be performed via Duo Passcode even if your device loses internet connection. To setup this method, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#tablet2. \nOption 3: Cell Phone (non-smartphone)\nFor individuals without a smartphone, non-smartphones can be used to authenticate your logins via phone call or SMS. To setup this method, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#cellphone2.\nOption 4: Hard token\nA hard token is a small, physical device that connects to a computer or other smart device via USB-A or USB-C. When prompted to authenticate via Duo MFA, the hard token serves as your second factor (\"something you have\") and is used to generate a Duo Passcode. Users may purchase hard tokens from ITS Site License for a nominal fee by visiting https://hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/.\nWhat if I don't have access to any authentication methods?\nYubikey hard tokens (both USB-A and USB-C variants) are available for purchase via ITS' Site Licensing office. See https://hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/ for more information or to purchase a token.\nStudents, faculty, and staff can inquire with the ITS Help Desk for additional options.\nCan I request an exception to the MFA requirement?\nNo. There are no exceptions to the MFA requirement. Required users must enroll in MFA. Refer to the Affected Users table above for more information on which users are required to enroll in MFA.\nCan I opt-out once enrolled in MFA?\nNo. Users cannot opt-out of MFA. This applies to all users, including users who are not required to enroll in MFA - any former students/alumnus, former faculty/staff, or retirees who elect to enroll in MFA will not be able to opt-out."

    "title": "Traveling with Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)",
    "content": "Plan Ahead\nThere are many options to authenticate with Duo MFA and several of them will still function even if you find yourself without cell service or a stable network connection on your travels. However, it's important to consider the conditions you might encounter on your travels that may impact how you authenticate. Planning ahead and understanding whether or not you may need to add devices or change how you authenticate before you board your flight will help ensure you're prepared and able to log in, no matter what.\nTry to answer these key questions before traveling and as you continue to read below:\n\n    Which second factor devices will you have access to during your travels?\n    \n        Will you have access to a smartphone or tablet?\n        Will you have access to a (non-smart) cellphone?\n        Will you have access to a landline?\n        Do you have a hard token?\n    \n    \n    Will you have access to cellular service, mobile data, or WiFi?\n    Are you traveling to a country subject to export controls?\n\nShort on time? Check out our quick reference guide: The ABCs of Traveling with Duo MFA.\nSelect Appropriate MFA Method(s) \nIt is important to understand which authentication methods will work for you and under what circumstances before you travel. If the device or authentication method that you normally use will not work during your travels, you will need to add a different authentication method ahead of time.\nFor instructions on adding any of the authentication methods below for use with your Duo MFA, please see our Adding Devices article.\nFor instructions on how to use any of the below methods to authenticate when logging in, please see our Logging in with MFA article.\n If you will have access to a smartphone or tablet:\n\n    OPTION 1: Use the Duo Mobile app to send a push to your smartphone or tablet. Requires mobile data or WiFi.\n    OPTION 2: Use the Duo Mobile app to generate a passcode. Does not require mobile data or WiFi, will work even when completely offline.\n    OPTION 3: Send yourself passcodes via SMS. Passcodes are sent in batches of ten (10) and you can use the passcodes in sequence to authenticate (once per passcode). Cell service is required to receive the SMS with the passcodes, but the ten (10) passcodes can be referenced and used even if you subsequently lose reception or service.\n    OPTION 4: Receive a phone call to your cellphone. Press '1' when prompted to approve your authentication. Cell service or WiFi calling is required to receive phone calls.\n\nIf you will have access to a (non-smart) cellphone:\n\n    OPTION 1: Send yourself passcodes via SMS. Passcodes are sent in batches of ten (10) and you can use the passcodes in sequence to authenticate (once per passcode). Cell service is required to receive the SMS with the passcodes, but the ten (10) passcodes can be referenced and used even if you subsequently lose reception or service.\n    OPTION 2: Receive a phone call to your cellphone. Press '1' when prompted to approve your authentication. Cell service is required to receive phone calls.\n\nIf you will have access to a landline:\n\n    OPTION 1: Receive a phone call to your landline. Press '1' when prompted to approve your authentication. Requires telephone service.\n\nIf you will have access to a hard token:\n\n    OPTION 1: Plug your hard token into a USB port on your laptop/computer, and press the button on the hard token when prompted to authenticate.\n\nGeneral Recommendations\nUse the Duo Mobile app\n\nIt is highly recommended to setup and use the Duo Mobile app if you will have access to a smartphone or tablet during your travels. The Duo Mobile app allows you to authenticate via push notifications if you have access to mobile data or WiFi. The Duo Mobile app also allows you to generate and use passcodes even if you find yourself completely offline!\nAdd multiple devices\nIt is recommended to add an additional device. Should your primary authentication device be lost or stolen, you may find yourself unable to login.\nSend yourself a batch of SMS passcodes before you leave\nRegardless of what method you ultimately choose for your travels, it is recommended to send yourself a batch of SMS passcodes before you leave. These passcodes can be accessed and used in sequence even if you do not have mobile data, WiFi, or reception. They can also be written or copied to another medium for use if you don't have access to your phone. Please remember to keep your passcodes secure! See our Logging in with MFA article for instruction on how to send yourself a batch of SMS passcodes.\nTraveling to Export Controlled Countries?\nThe following countries and regions are under sanctions by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and all Duo authentication methods (Duo Mobile, Duo passcodes and SMS passciodes, phone calls, and hard tokens) will not function as they are blocked within their borders.\n\n    Cuba (CU)\n    North Korea - Democratic People's Republic of Korea (KP)\n    Iran (IR)\n    Sudan (SD)\n    Syria (SY)\n    Crimea region (43)\n    Donetsk region (14)\n    Luhansk region (09)\n    Sevastopol region (40)\n\nPlease contact the ITS Help Desk if you are planning to travel to any these countries or regions. If you are traveling to these countries or regions, you are required to uninstall the Duo Mobile app from any devices you will be taking with you and are prohibited from traveling with hard tokens. All authentications from these embargoed destinations will result in an \"Access denied. Duo Security does not provide services in your current location.\" message.\nTrouble Logging in When Traveling?\nIf you're having any difficulty logging in when traveling, please contact the ITS Help Desk. Support available 24x7."

Students must be currently enrolled in good standing; faculty and staff must be current employees of UH. For eligibility requirements and procedures for obtaining an UH Username, see UH Username Practices.\nYour UH Username provides you access to the following online services:\nNote: This list of services is not exhaustive. There are many other online services that leverage the UH Username for access.\n\n    Google@UH - Your UH Username provides access to Google Apps for Education, which include Google@UH Gmail, Google@UH Calendar, and Google@UH Drive.\n    \n        Gmail - Your UH Username becomes your Internet email address. For example, John Doe with UH Username jdoe will have an email address of jdoe@hawaii.edu. You can access your UH email on any computer on the Internet with a Web browser using Google@UH Gmail. Client software, such as Thunderbird (Mac or PC) or Outlook (PC), can also be used to access your email account, and you can even setup your UH email account on a mobile device.\n        Calendar - Your UH Username is also linked to Google@UH Calendar, which is a fully-featured calendaring solution. You can access your calendars using a web browser, or setup your calendars on a mobile device.\n        Drive - Your UH Username provides access to Google@UH Drive, which can be used for file storage, file sharing, and collaboration.\n        Google@UH Storage Policy - Your Google@UH storage quota is based on your current affiliation. https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1882\n        Google@UH Service Availability Matrix - Your UH username can also provide access to Google Consumer Apps. Some features are only available for Faculty/Staff licenses. View the Service Availability Matrix\n    \n    \n    Campus Wireless - Each campus offers a wireless network for faculty, staff, and students to utilize, with your UH Username and password being used for access.\n    MyUH - This academic portal contains links to many online services for UH faculty, staff, and students.\n    Password Administration - You can manage your password for your UH Username online. Password administration also includes management of your secret questions and answers. You can fall back on these if they are wisely chosen to allow you to recover from losing or forgetting your password.\n    First.Last Email Alias - Faculty and Staff may designate a first.last email address alias for use on business cards, or other professional purposes. For example, John Doe may designate john.doe@hawaii.edu as an alias for his regular UH email address, jdoe@hawaii.edu. This service is not currently available for students.\n    Spam Filtering - Spam is unsolicited email messages sent to your email account. Spam is also referred to as \"unsolicited commercial email\" and \"unsolicited bulk email\". They range from harmless advertising to potentially offensive (complete with pictures). Spam is very similar to \"junk mail\" that you receive in your regular postal mailbox. See Spam at the University of Hawaii.\n    Software Downloads - Faculty, staff, and students of the UH community may download software online, including anti-virus software for PCs and Macs. ITS licenses anti-virus protection software for all institutional and personal computers. Take the time to install the software and keep up with the free updates supplied via the Web.\n    UH Online Directory - An online directory of UH faculty and staff is provided to students, faculty and staff to help members of the University keep in touch.\n    Personal Webpages - Your UH Username permits you to create a personal homepage on the World Wide Web. John Doe with UH Username jdoe would create a homepage at http://www2.hawaii.edu/~jdoe.\n    Student Employment - Students and UH employers have access to online services using their UH Username and depending on the requirements of Student Employment offices. Visit http://www.hawaii.edu/sece for more information.\n    Mailing Lists - A mailing list is a tool for communicating with a specific group of people via email. Mailing lists are useful for discussions and announcements. Faculty and staff may request a mailing list for a topic directly related to the academic and/or administrative work of the University of Hawaii.\n\n \nThere is normally no charge for a UH Username or the above services. Please note, however, for Non-Credit students: due to the manual processes of creating and maintaining UH Usernames for non-credit students, there will be a nominal assessed fee to create accounts for programs that want their students to have a UH Username for email or access privileges. Previously ITS was absorbing the costs, but regrettably now needs to pass on the costs. Fee is set at $10 per UH Username per semester of full service. For additional questions, please call the ITS Help Desk and ask to escalate to a staff member.\nResources\nPassword Administration: http://www.hawaii.edu/username\nEmail Services: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/563\nFirst.Last Email Alias: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/511\nSpam at the University of Hawaii: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/571\nMyUH: http://myuh.hawaii.edu\nSoftware Downloads: http://www.hawaii.edu/software\nOnline Directory Listing: http://www.hawaii.edu/dir\nPersonal Web Pages: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/694\nStudent Employment: http://www.hawaii.edu/sece\nMailing Lists: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/listRequest\nUNIX System: http://www.hawaii.edu/itsdocs/cen/unxbasic.pdf\nref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/uhusername.html"

    "title": "In Brief: Differences Between a Virus, Worm, and Trojan Horse",
    "content": "Please keep in mind that these definitions may change as computer viruses become more complex. As of this revision, the computer virus authors are combining two or more viruses together to make one new virus. The new virus combines the features of each virus into one so that the virus will slip past the anti-virus software. It is very important to keep your anti-virus software updated.\nVirus\nA computer virus is a program that is designed to replicate itself and spread from file to file, usually attaching itself to applications. When this application is run, it can infect other files on a user's disk. By definition, human interaction is necessary for a virus to spread to another user's files. This can be performed by downloading files, trading diskettes with others, copying files to/from file servers, or sending email attachments. To combat a virus, be sure to use anti-virus software like McAfee's VirusScan or Norton Anti-virus from Symantec.\nWorm\nA computer worm also infects other computers, but it is spread to other computers on a network automatically and without the action of humans. This allows computer worms to spread more rapidly than computer viruses. A worm doesn't alter or delete files but instead they reside in memory, eat up system resources, and slow down your computer. To protect against a worm, networked users must keep up with operating system patches and updates and be aware of any suspicious traffic.\nTrojan Horse\nA Trojan Horse is a program that initially appears useful or benign and fools a user into running it. But while it runs, it could be allowing \"back door\" access to your computer by hackers or destroying files on your hard disk. For protection against a Trojan Horse, users must be suspicious of any unknown program and be sure it is safe before running it."

It is very important that spam blocking is not overly aggressive such that legitimate email is also blocked. There are other emerging approaches to dealing with spam.

    "title": "Network Etiquette",
    "content": "Certain situations call for proper protocol to be observed. In bowling, one does not interrupt the person bowling in adjacent lanes by throwing the ball while they are already in the process of doing so. In tennis, returning a ball that is obviously out is considered poor form. On the Internet, sending unsolicited or irrelevant material, especially if done in a widespread fashion, is of the utmost rudeness.\nVeteran users of the Internet expect others, especially newcomers, to learn and observe proper network etiquette or netiquette. Here are the most common--yet grave--faux pas one can commit on the Internet:\nSending chain mail: Unfortunately this annoying activity has made its way into email. Chain mail greatly upsets and annoys those who receive it, regardless of whether the recipient believes in it or not. It simply boils down to misused and wasted computing resources.\nSending irrelevant email to one or more mailing lists (also known as \"spamming\"): People subscribe to mailing lists because they want to participate in discussions and receive information related to the topic of the list. Because mail processing requires the message to be appended to each individual's mailbox, this type of netiquette violation wastes an incredible amount of computer and network resources. Furthermore, because an intrusion on their personal mailbox has occurred, users will react and reply to the offender with usually not-so-kind words.\nSending email to a random number of users on a system: This is exactly the same as the previous type of offense with the exception that instead of a subject-specific mailing list, mail is sent to a random number of users on one or more systems. Everything we said about the previous type of offense applies to this type just as well.\nPosting an article to a Usenet newsgroup whose contents have nothing to do with the newsgroup's topic: Unfortunately, when this happens, the irrelevant article is often sent to more than one newsgroup, magnifying the offense and causing a barrage of reactions to be sent back and forth across the Internet. Although postings about controversial topics, commercial advertising, and promotion of private interest tend to draw the most clamor for resolution, seemingly valid and innocuous postings like a survey about email usage also draw angry reactions from the Internet.\nNetiquette violations do a lot more than raise eyebrows. Those who get upset will reply and because a large audience is usually involved, the number of responses traveling back and forth across the Internet take up precious bandwidth that could have been used for more worthwhile traffic. An overwhelming number of replies also puts stress on the system where the unwanted message originated. System managers need to monitor their system's well-being and have to spend time responding to complaints from angry users who demand that the individual who sent the unsolicited message be immediately brought to justice. A good day's work can quickly be spent doing damage control caused by bad network etiquette. Therefore, exercise restraint before sending a reply to the offender or a complaint to the system manager because there is a good chance that someone else has already done so.\nThe Internet's spirit of harmonious, free-flowing information exchange that researchers, educators, and professionals have come to love and expect is constantly being challenged by an ever increasing population brought about by media coverage and commercial hype about the so-called information superhighway. To put it in terms of this overused buzzword, new drivers jump onto the information superhighway without proper driver education instilled in them. Consider this article a first lesson in Internet driver education.\nObserving the simple network etiquette rule of not sending unsolicited or irrelevant material to a widespread audience makes the Internet a more productive and pleasant place for all of us.\nFor more information on network etiquette, refer to the following Web site: http://www.albion.com/netiquette/\nIn addition, view the UH Executive Policy E2.210 \"Use and Management of Information Technology Resources\"."

Spam is also referred to as \"unsolicited commercial email\" and \"unsolicited bulk email\". They range from harmless advertising to potentially offensive (complete with pictures). Spam is very similar to \"junk mail\" that you receive in your regular postal mailbox.\nref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html#what\n\n\n\n\n\tWhy am I getting all this spam?\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSpammers (the people who send spam) \"harvest\" email addresses from various places. If you have done anything on the Internet at all (register a software product, participated in a online discussion board), your address could potentially be harvested by spammers.\nEven if you hardly do anything on the Internet, as long as you have some kind of presence (even just an email address), your address could still be the target of spam messages. Spammers have been known to launch attacks similar to \"cold calling\"; they'll keep trying email addresses until they find a valid one. For example, a spammer could send a message to hawaii.edu addresses and just use all known common first names before the @ sign. The invalid ones will bounce, but the valid ones will get delivered.\nref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html#why\n\n\n\n\n\tWhat is ITS doing about spam?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGoogle uses a combination of algorithms and reporting tools to protect against spam, viruses, and phishing attacks. Using the same advanced computing infrastructure as its search engine, along with a vast community of users, Google touts having one of the best spam blockers in the business.\nFor more information on Google and spam, click on https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1366858?hl=en.\nref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html#whatisits\n\n\n\n\n\tWhat can I do about spam?\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    Look over your Inbox and manually delete messages that seem suspicious before you begin reading your new messages. Examples of suspicious messages include:\n    \n        messages with missing or strange subject lines\n        messages with attachments that you were not expecting\n    \n    \n    \n    Minimize any unnecessary public display of your email address in order to limit your exposure to spammers who \"harvest\" email addresses off the Web. This is an unfortunate trade-off that each person needs to make for themselves, but addresses that are never seen are less susceptible to spam.\n    \n    Most current email client software have some form of spam blocking built in. You can setup your email client so that it either marks suspicious messages as spam or moves these messages to a separate folder. Please be sure to test these settings very carefully to ensure that you do not create false positives and lose emails that are important to you.\n    \n    Do not reply to spam messages asking the spammers to stop; this will confirm that your email address is valid.\n    \n    Disable remote image or HTML image loading in your email client.\n    \n    It is critical that you turn off the message preview pane if you are using an email client such as Thunderbird or Outlook. This will help prevent you from inadvertently opening a spam message.\n    \n    Report spam sent from a hawaii.edu address to uhabuse@hawaii.edu.  Please include a copy of the message with full mail headers.\n    Note that the uhabuse@hawaii.edu address is just for reporting spam.  Any questions should be sent to the ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu.\n    \n\nref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html#whati\n\n\n\n\n\tIs there anything I can do about messages that are incorrectly marked as spam?\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    Contact the sender of the message and let them know their messages are being quarantined as spam. There could be some misconfiguration on their mail server that is causing their messages to be tagged.\n    Add the person to your contacts (https://support.google.com/contacts/answer/1069522) and/or create a filter so messages from a particular sender do not go to the spam folder (https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579). \n\nref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html\n\n\n\n\n\tEven with all this, I still receive spam!\n\n\n\n\tSpammers are very aggressive in finding new ways to get their spam through any protective measures. ITS is making a concerted effort to isolate spam email before you receive it. But given differences in perception, there will never be a way to automatically identify 100% of spam without also blocking some amount of email that would be considered legitimate. It is very important that spam blocking is not overly aggressive such that legitimate email is also blocked. There are other emerging approaches to dealing with spam. Some involve the use of specialized or single-use email addresses and many of which require some amount of manual intervention at least once on the part of the sender or receiver to identify legitimate messages. ITS will continue to monitor the tools available to do our best for our email users.\nref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html#buti\n\n\n\n\n\tReporting a suspicious email regarding University of Hawaii\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nTo report a suspicious email saying it's from the University of Hawaii and asking for confidential information:\nFIRST: Check to see if the phishing attempt has already been reported by looking at the Security Alerts listing on http://www.hawaii.edu/its/\n\n    If the suspicious email is claiming to be another organization, e.g., credit union, bank, etc., forward it to the abuse team of that company.  There is no need to forward other company's phishing scams to phishing@hawaii.edu\n    forward a copy of the message with full mail headers displayed to phishing@hawaii.edu\n    To display the full email header in Google@UH Gmail (webmail):\n    \n        Log in to Gmail using a web browser.\n        Open the message you'd like to view headers for.\n        Click the down arrow (says More) next to Reply, at the top of the message pane.\n        Select Show Original.\n    \n    The full email headers will appear in a new window. Copy and paste full email header into the forwarded message.\n    [to get full mail headers for other email clients, please see http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/895 ]\n    If you would like to receive phishing notices by email, go to http://www.hawaii.edu/its/notices/index.php and subscribe to our phishing-alert email list.\n    \n\nTo prevent  compromises:\n\n    NEVER send your password or other confidential personal information in an email message, even in reply to a message that appears 100% genuine. No responsible entity requests information this way.\n    \n    DO NOT REPLY to suspicious or spam mail. It just tells the spammers/hackers that they've hit a valid email address.\n    \n    \n    if you receive a message asking you to \"reactivate your account\", \"validate your account\", or \"get more email quota\", DO NOT click on the weblink and enter your username and password\n    \n    \n    make sure you're up-to-date with all operating systems (e.g. Windows) updates\n    \n    \n    make sure you're up-to-date with any anti-virus and anti-spyware updates\n    \n    \n    review document Securing your Desktop Computer\n    \n    \n    don't save passwords to your email account on your system, it might take a few more seconds to login manually, but it might save you hours of time cleaning up after a compromise\n    \n\n If you suspect that you are compromised...\n\n    Please review our article: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/892\n\n \n\n\nref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html"

Contact the ITS Help Desk for support by calling 808-956-8883 (Oahu) or toll free (800) 558-2669, sending an email to help@hawaii.edu, connecting via Live Chat, or visiting the IT Center or ITS Computer Labs for walk-in support (Manoa campus only). Visit https://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk/ for hours of operation and for more information on the support channels provided by the ITS Help Desk.\nSupported Users\nThe ITS Help Desk will provide technical support as outlined in this policy for Supported Users consisting of current UH faculty, staff, students (including new and returning students), and active affiliates. ITS Help Desk-provided support for our ‘Ohana Users (former students, faculty, and staff) will be limited to setting up, accessing, and operating their UH Usernames and the associated services available to our ‘Ohana Users. Unfortunately, the ITS Help Desk does not have the resources to provide technical support for the personal computing devices of unaffiliated or formerly affiliated users unless being used for university-related work purposes.\nTechnical Support Provided\nTechnical support provided by the ITS Help Desk includes:\n\n    Assistance with setting up, accessing, and operating your UH Username \n    Assistance with accessing, operating, and troubleshooting issues with ITS-managed online services\n    Setup, troubleshooting, and basic operation of Supported Computing Devices\n    Assistance with basic network connectivity to campus-provided wired and wireless networks for Supported Computing Devices\n    Setup, troubleshooting, and operation of supported software. Setup of unsupported software is limited to installation only (no additional setup/configuration will be done). Installation of unsupported software will be performed on a \"best effort\" basis. The ITS Help Desk cannot and will not assist with downloading, installing, configuring, or troubleshooting any unlicensed, pirated, or otherwise illegally obtained software.\n    Limited “best effort” support for software and computing devices not explicitly supported under this policy, and personal computing devices not being used for university-related work purposes\n\nRemote Support\nTechnical support through the ITS Help Desk is provided to Supported Users remotely via phone, email, or live chat. Secure remote support software can also be used to allow Supported Users to share their devices’ screen(s) in order to facilitate faster and more thorough on-device troubleshooting and problem resolution by ITS Help Desk Consultants.\nWalk-in Support\nFor Supported Users physically located at the Manoa campus, the ITS Help Desk also offers walk-in support both at our service window located in the Information Technology Center and at the ITS Computer Labs during monitored hours. Visit https://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk/ for Information Technology Center hours of operation or visit https://www.hawaii.edu/its/its-computer-labs-at-uh-manoa/ for ITS Computer Labs hours of operation.\nOn-site Technical Support (Manoa Campus faculty and staff only)\nFor faculty and staff of departments on the Manoa campus with problems that cannot be resolved remotely, an ITS Help Desk Technician can be scheduled to perform an on-site consultation for problem diagnosis and resolution. On-site visits are provided for Supported Computing Devices owned and/or used by the department for performing university-related work.\nOn-site assistance with the setup of new university-owned devices is also available by an ITS Help Desk Technician. The standard setup will include installation of all OS critical updates, anti-virus software, and peripheral setup. Optionally, the Technician can install requested supported programs (e.g. web browser, email client, Acrobat Reader, Microsoft Office, etc.), and will be sure to install all associated software updates. They can also assist with configuring the computer to regularly check for and install critical software and OS updates.\nOn-site support will be declined for personal computing devices which are not used for university-related work purposes. Remote or walk-in support (through the ITC Service Window or ITS Computer Labs) are available for these personally owned devices.\n\nSupported Computing Devices\nSupported Computing Devices include devices in use by Supported Users for university-related work that fall under one of the categories below:\n\n    Desktop and laptop computers running a supported operating system (see Operating System (OS) Software Support below for currently supported operating systems)\n    Manufacturer-supported mobile phones running supported iOS or Android operating systems\n    Manufacturer-supported tablet-type devices running supported iOS, macOS, Android, or Windows operating systems\n    Computer peripherals, such as mice, keyboards, docks, webcams, printers, multifunction devices, and scanners\n    Ethernet switches or hubs\n\nPersonal computing devices in use by Supported Users that fall under one of the categories above, but that are not used for university-related work purposes are excluded from this definition of Supported Computing Devices, and would fall under “best effort” support. Other examples of devices excluded from Supported Computing Sevices:\n\n    Departmental computer lab, departmental classroom, or departmental audio/visual devices and equipment\n    Routers, wireless access points, hotspots, network attached storage (NAS) devices, and other networking equipment external to the University-maintained wired and wireless networks (switches and hubs excluded)\n    Digital cameras, video cameras, capture cards, and network cameras\n    Single-board computer (SBC) or single-board microcontroller (SBM) devices (such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.)\n    Internet of Things (IoT) devices including casting or streaming devices used for non-University related business\n    Video game consoles, hand-held gaming devices, etc.\n\n\n\nThe ITS Help Desk provides “best effort” support for computing devices configured to use a foreign language. Supported users with these computing devices are encouraged to set their device’s language to English when seeking support, or to check within their department for other faculty/staff with similar configurations for help. Below are some resources within the University of Hawaii for foreign language support:\n\n    The College of Arts, Languages, and Letters provides limited help and maintains computer labs with foreign language support built-in to Windows which are available to their college faculty and staff free of charge or to others for a fee.\n    UH Hilo maintains a website for the Hawaiian Language at https://www.olelo.hawaii.edu/.\n\nIf you have information on additional sources of foreign language support that you'd like to share, please email help@hawaii.edu.\n\nDepartmental Computer Labs and Classrooms\nUnfortunately, the ITS Help Desk does not have the resources necessary to provide cost-free support for computing devices purchased for departmental computer labs, departmental classrooms, or departmental audio/visual setups, nor can the ITS Help Desk manage custom or unsupported departmental infrastructure. It is the responsibility of the department to provide the necessary staffing and resources to support these types of computing devices and/or infrastructure. ITS may be contracted to provide support for these devices for a fee.\n\n\n \n\n“Best Effort” Support\nThe ITS Help Desk may provide “best effort” support to Supported Users seeking assistance with unsupported software or devices. The ITS Help Desk will attempt “best effort” problem resolution for no more than one hour within the limits of the collective knowledge of the ITS Help Desk staff. This “best effort” support does not extend to the (re)installation of unsupported operating systems, the configuration/setup of unsupported software (beyond basic installation), nor the configuration/setup of routers, wireless access points, print servers, network cameras, IoT devices, and other excluded devices.\n \nShould problem resolution either:\n\n    require knowledge beyond what the ITS Help Desk staff currently have,\n    exceed one hour of work time to resolve, or\n    be unattainable after exhausting all reasonable avenues of problem troubleshooting,\n\nthen the problem will be deemed unresolvable and no further action will be taken to troubleshoot.\n \n\nOperating System (OS) Software Support\nThe ITS Help Desk will repair, reinstall, or troubleshoot problems with the following computer Operating Systems:\n\n    Supported Windows versions\n    Supported macOS versions\n\nIf reinstallation of an OS and/or reformatting of a hard drive are determined to be necessary, an ITS Help Desk Technician may provide assistance. Users should have their own license key available for the Technician, or if the OS was purchased through one of the UH Site License programs, users should make arrangements to have the license key(s) and installation media on-hand at the time of the scheduled appointment.\n \nSupported Usersare generally responsible for backing up any necessary data they need on their computer and are encouraged to consider an appropriate backup strategy. The ITS Help Desk can assist with data backup and restore only if time and resources permit, and will require that a Supported User present a detailed list of data on the computing device that needs to be backed up, as well as appropriate and sufficiently sized media onto which this data can be moved/copied. The ITS Help Desk Technician will not be responsible for data erased from a computing device that was not explicitly specified for backup prior to an OS reinstallation.\n \nNote: Depending on the reason for OS repair or reinstallation, data backup and restore may not be possible. The ITS Help Desk encourages all users to maintain their own backups in the unfortunate event of data loss.\n\n\n \n\nSoftware Support\nA list of ITS Supported Software is posted at https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/575.\n \n\nLimited Hardware Support\nOn-site hardware support is limited to University-owned and operated equipment.\n \nCAUTION: Equipment under warranty should be checked with the vendor first, as some warranties may be invalidated if a non-authorized person attempts to repair the equipment.\n \nAn ITS Help Desk Technician can install or troubleshoot on-site standard computer hardware components (e.g. DIMMs, video cards, wired or wireless Ethernet adapters, m.2 or sata storage devices, optical disc drives, etc.). The Technician can install or remove hardware components from a computer, but not necessarily repair faulty hardware components nor their integrated circuitry.\n \nNote: Laptops often have different or non-standard hardware configurations or requirements and limited serviceability when compared to typical ATX desktop computers. Hardware support for laptops is generally \"best effort\" only.\n \nServer Support\nA designated staff server administrator is required for any server hosted at UH. The administrator is responsible for the maintenance of server hardware, any necessary software, management of user accounts, actively applying security and OS patches, backups, and general troubleshooting of the server. If a department has no designated staff server administrator, and that server has any problems with compromise, viruses, or security, ITS reserves the right to remove the server from the UH Network.\n \nFor information on ITS-provided virtual server or co-location services, please visit https://hawaii.edu/askus/1181."

For Manoa campus, please call your IT department or the ITS Help Desk for additional assistance.\nThe information below will provide you with information on how to best secure your computer from being compromised by unauthorized intrusions and viruses. Please note that despite one's efforts, there is no product that will stop a determined hacker.\n\nBasics\n\n    Keep your software up-to-date. Periodically, companies will release updates that provide software enhancements and security fixes. For Microsoft Windows, Microsoft provides an auto-update feature. You should also install security updates for application software such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.\n    Install anti-virus software and update the virus definition file regularly. Active University of Hawaii faculty, staff, and students may download anti-virus software.\n    For email attachments, if you have any hesitations, please do not open attachments you receive. Email attachments are a common source of viruses. Gmail automatically scans attachments for viruses when the attachment is delivered to you, when you open the attachment, and when you attach a file.\n    For further protection, a firewall product might be needed. Most desktop systems don't necessarily have to have this, as it requires someone with some technical knowledge and time to manage well. However, firewalls will lower the odds of an unauthorized access to your computer and might be necessary if the data is extremely confidential and requires additional security. It should be noted that with a firewall, ITS standard network troubleshooting techniques can no longer be used (firewalls will also block our efforts to ensure that your Internet connections are working). Users are required to have their own IT Specialist to troubleshoot their firewall and any network connections for their computers behind a firewall.\n\n\n\nSecurity Updates and Operating System updates\nMicrosoft Windows has an auto-update feature. This auto-update feature periodically connects to the Microsoft website to see if they are any updates to your Windows Operating System or Microsoft Office (if installed). If any updates are available, the auto-update feature will let you know. It will then give you an option to install, install later, or deny the new updates. To manually check for updates:\n\n    For Windows 10: Open the Start Menu and click on the settings wheel, Update & Security settings, in the Windows Update-Update Status click on the updates button.\n\nmacOS also has an auto-update feature through the Mac App Store. Like Microsoft Windows, the auto-update feature will periodically check the Apple website for updates. If updates are found, the feature will notify you. If you would like to manually check for updates, click on the apple icon in the top left corner of the menu bar and click “App Store…”, then navigate to the “Updates” tab. You can also visit https://support.apple.com/downloads.\nMS Office Updates\nMicrosoft releases updates for their Microsoft Office software. These updates provide feature enhancements, bug fixes, and security fixes. Microsoft Office updates are included with Windows Updates.\nEmail Scanning\nIf you use a departmental email server, please check with your IT support person to see if anti-virus protection is provided. If anti-virus protection is not available, you can still protect your department issued email account by forwarding email through your Google@UH email account first. In addition to setting up email forwarding you should advertise your @hawaii.edu account so that email messages will be routed through the Google@UH email server and scanned by the anti-virus and SPAM scanner before it reaches your department-issued email address.\n\n\nAnti-Virus\nActive UH faculty, staff, and students are eligible to install anti-virus software provided by ITS. NOTE: UH faculty, staff, and students must remove the software from any personal computers once they are no longer affiliated with the University. You may download it here.\n\n\nFirewall\nAlthough, ITS does not support any particular firewall product, there are several you may want to try. If you feel that you may have discovered a firewall software that ITS should test and support, please send email to help@hawaii.edu.\n\n\nPasswords\nAll user accounts on your computer should have a password, especially your Administrator or Power User accounts. If you are mapping any drives from/to your computer, please make sure they are password protected. Some viruses propagate via unprotected drive mappings. The following password guidelines article can help you select a strong (difficult to guess or to break) password:  https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/705\nEncryption\nIf you keep any sensitive information on your computer, the information should be encrypted. Current versions of Windows and MacOS operating systems have built-in encryption features.  For more details on using Windows encryption, please read:  https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1285.  For MacOS encyption, please read: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/676.\nThere are also third-party encryption applications like GPG.\nPhysical Security\nAccess control:  Physical access to machines should be controlled and monitored.  Unknown individuals should NOT be able to walk up to any unattended computer unchallenged.  In open environments, physical lockdown devices (cable security locks, CPU locks, etc.) should be considered.  Lock individual office doors at the end of the day.  Provide as many layers of defense as possible.\nPartitioning of physical environments into security zones:  More sensitve computers should be located in areas that can be more tightly locked down.\nAlarm systems:  Depending on the sensitivity of the information stored on servers and computers, 3rd party alarm systems may be a consideration.\nEducation:  People are the best alarms.  If someone does not belong in the area, they should be physically challenged:  ask the unknown individual if they need help, what business they have, who sent them, and call to check credentials (but call a number from a trusted source).  You can always ask them to return at a pre-arranged date and time.  If it's legitimate, they will return.\nBackups\nMake regular backups of your critical data (at a minimum) and test your backups to ensure that they are readable. ITS supported versions of Windows and macOS have a backup features built-in to the operating system. To learn more about each, visit their websites at:\nWindows: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore\nmacOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250\n \nlast updated: August 2018"

A backup is especially useful if the hard drive crashes, or     when you want to transfer your email to another computer.  This document will discuss how     to create a backup of the Mail e-mail folder on the MAC OS X platform.\nLocating the email folder\nThe first step to creating a backup of the e-mail folder is locating it.  The default location is    in your Home folder, in the Library folder, in the Mail folder. By default, the Library folder is hidden.  To access it, click on the Go menu in the Finder while holding down the option key on your keyboard.  Then click on Library.  A window will open similar to the figure below.  In this Library folder, scroll to find the Mail folder. \n\nBackup Email Folder\nThe Mail folder is the folder that you need to back up.  Place a copy of this folder     on external media (CD/DVD, flash drive, external HD, etc.) or place it on a secure server if you have access     to one."

    "title": "Backing Up Thunderbird Emails for MacOS",
    "content": "Please note that this documentation assumes you have set up your email in Thunderbird with IMAP or POP3.  If you do not already have IMAP/POP3 enabled in your email address settings you will first need to enable less secure apps in Google.  Instructions to do so may be found here.  Once enabled, you may go here for instructions on how to enable IMAP/POP3 for your gmail account.  If you are using Gmail 2-step verification, you may need to create an app-specific password when signing into your gmail account.  Instructions to do so can be found here.  If you are using POP3, you will need to update your authentication setting to use OAuth2 for both incoming and outgoing server settings.  This is done by clicking on “Configure manually…” at the bottom left window after entering in your email address.\nGeneral Information on Mozilla Thunderbird\nMozilla Thunderbird will automatically create a Thunderbird Profile which stores your email data and Thunderbird configurations.  If you would like to create a backup of your email data you will first have to locate your Thunderbird Profile.  Once located you will have two options: copying your entire profile, or copying just your email data.  Instructions on how to locate your Thunderbird Profile are included below.  All screenshots taken in this article were done in MacOS Catalina version 10.15.4.\nLocating Your Thunderbird Profile\nTo locate your profile, click on Help within the Thunderbird menu bar at the top.  From there, click on Troubleshooting Information which should open a new tab with that name.  Under the Application Basics header there will be a field labeled Profiles with a link, “about:profiles” next to it.  Clicking on that link will open a new tab called About Profiles and will display all of the Thunderbird profiles you currently have.  The current profile in use will be indicated by a “yes” next to the Default Profile field.  Click on the “Show in Finder” button in the Root Directory field to be taken directly to your profile.\n\nCopying Your Entire Thunderbird Profile\nOnce you have located your profile folder, you can simply copy and paste the entire folder into a desired location to create a backup.\nCopying Your Email Data\nIf you would like to copy just your email data, there are two different ways to go about this.\n\n    Copying all of your email data - The steps for this option will differ slightly depending on whether you used IMAP or POP3 when setting up your email account in Thunderbird.\n    Copying specific email folders to Local Folders - This will require you to set up Local Folders and move mail into them from whichever email folders you would like to backup.\n\n The following sections contain the instructions on how to copy your data using the above methods:\nCopying All Email Data (from an IMAP or POP3 Account)\nIf you have set up your email account using IMAP, your emails will be stored in the “ImapMail” folder.  You can copy and paste that folder onto a storage device for a backup.    If you have set up your email account using POP3, your emails will be stored in the “Mail” folder under “pop.service-name.com”.  The ‘service-name’ will be the type of account you use, such as Gmail or Yahoo.  You can copy and paste that folder onto a storage device for a backup.\nCopying Specific Email Folders to Local Folders\nInstead of copying all of your emails through your Thunderbird Profile or through email folders for IMAP or POP3, you may instead choose to copy specific email folders in the Thunderbird application to Local Folders that you will need to set up manually and move your email to them.\nCreating Local Folders\nThe first step in moving your mail to your hard drive is to create local mail folders that have the same name as your folders on the mail server.\n\n    \n        In the list of folders on the left side pane, click once on \"Local Folders\" to select it.  Go to the \"File\" menu, select New, then select Folder      \n    \n    \n        The \"Create as a subfolder of\" should already be set to \"Local Folders\"         \n    \n    \n        In the \"Name\" box, type UH Email Backup.  Click Create Folder.        \n    \n    \n        If necessary, click on the triangle next to Local Folders to expand it and see your newly created folder.         \n    \n    \n        Click once on the \"UH Email Backup\" folder to select it.  Go to the \"File\" menu, select New, the select Subfolder.               \n    \n    \n        Make sure the \"Create as a subfolder of\" is set to UH Email Backup.      \n    \n    \n        In the \"Name\" box, type Inbox. Click Create Folder.          \n    \n    \n        Repeat steps 5 - 7 and create folders for all the different folders that you wish to copy off of the server.  (E.g. Drafts, Sent, Trash, and whatever else is listed on the left-hand side under your hawaii.edu email address.)    \n    \n\nWhen you are done, if necessary, click on the triangle next to \"UH Email Backup\" to expand and show what's stored inside.  Your Thunderbird window should look similar to below, except with your information. The next step will be moving the mail to your newly created Local Folders.\n\nMoving Mail to Your Local Folders\nYou should try the following steps on a small amount of messages first.  Be sure you are comfortable with this process before attempting to move mail from a critical folder such as Sent or Inbox.  Before doing the steps below, please be sure you are not logged into your UH Gmail in a web browser or other computer.\n\n    You first have to select the folder that contains the messages you want to move.  In this example, we will move messages from the \"Inbox\" folder.  On the left side of the screen, click on the folder \"Inbox\" that's listed under the \"username@hawaii.edu\" section (do not select the one under \"UH Email Backup\").\n    Go to the \"Edit\" menu, select Select, then select All.  All the messages in the \"meetings\" folder will now be selected.  If there are a large amount of messages in the folder, do not use \"Select All\".  Instead, select a portion of the messages by clicking on the first message you want to move, then hold down the shift key and click on the last message you want to move.\n    Go to the \"Message\" menu\n    --> then select Copy To  [IMPORTANT: you should copy the messages rather than move them, in case anything goes wrong during the transfer]\n    --> then select Local Folders\n    --> then select UH Email Backup\n    --> then select Inbox (and let go of the mouse button)\n    The highlighted messages will be moved to the meetings folder.  Depending on how many messages you selected to move, this could take some time.\n    On the left side, select the Inbox folder under the UH Email Backup section and verify the messages are there.  Once you have verified that the messages were successfully copied, you may delete them from the server (in other words, delete them from under the \"username@hawaii.edu\" section).\n    Repeat steps 1 - 5 for each of the folders that you wish to move off of the server."

    "title": "IT Policy and Guidelines: UH Manoa Wireless Networks",
    "content": "As with all shared resources of the University, policies and guidelines are established to ensure equitable and reliable access to limited resources for all members of the University community.  The UH Manoa network infrastructure is considered to be a shared resource and as it is extended through the use of wireless network devices, it becomes essential to define and describe how wireless technologies are to be deployed to protect the accessibility and integrity of the entire UH network.  Use of the UH Manoa network (wired and wireless) is governed by UH Executive Policy: E2.210 -- Use and Management of Information Technology Resources.  This document is available on-line at:  http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/policies/itpolicy.html.\nThis document describes how wireless technologies are to be deployed, administered, and supported at the University of Hawaii Manoa campus.  General information about the UH Manoa wireless infrastructure can be found at: http://www.hawaii.edu/wireless.\nTo ensure the integrity, reliability, and security of the UH Manoa Network, Information Technology Services (ITS) reserves the right to restrict the use of wireless devices and/or determine what devices can be connected to the network and how these devices should be configured.\n \nPurpose\nThis document provides guidelines for deployment and usage of wireless devices on the Manoa Campus.  The guidelines provision a minimum level of wireless security, network reliability and will minimize network interference from other devices utilizing the same wireless frequency spectrum.\n \nScope of this document\nThis document is intended to cover any and all wireless devices within the UH Manoa campus.  This includes, but are not limited to, wireless access points, wireless routers, wireless phones, etc.\n \nSuitability\nFor data networks, wireless networks should not be considered a replacement for a wired network.  It should be seen only as an extension to the existing wired network for general purpose access in areas of transient use such as common areas.\nA wireless access point provides shared bandwidth.  As more users connect to the access point, the available bandwidth per user diminishes.  Therefore, wireless networks are not appropriate for high bandwidth applications such as video streaming.  It is most suited for applications such as email and Web browsing.\nWireless devices should not be used to access administrative information systems such as FMIS, ISIS/Banner, Peoplesoft, etc. that contain sensitive and confidential information unless using encrypted protocols.\nITS reserves the right to restrict access to services and resources that are disruptive to the wireless network, or pose a threat to the University's information security, audit or accreditation status when used from the wireless network.\n \nCoverage\nITS installs and maintains data wireless access in many buildings and public spaces.  This wireless coverage will continue to expand as resources become available.  For a more complete coverage map, please refer to: https://manoa.hawaii.edu/campusmap/wireless.php.\nData wireless networks in departmentally controlled spaces can be deployed in two ways:\n1) ITS -installed and managed; or\n2) self-supported:  departmentally/organizationally installed and managed.  Self-supported wireless networks must be installed  in consultation with ITS to prevent network outages, frequency conflicts, and to maintain the integrity of the UH Network by preventing unauthorized access.\n \nManagement & Support\nFor ITS installed and managed wireless devices in public spaces, ITS will assume responsibility to maintain, update, and upgrade these devices.\nFor ITS-installed and managed wireless devices in departmentally controlled spaces, ITS will assume responsibility to maintain, update, and upgrade these devices.  When consulting ITS, departments will be advised of the cost of installation and maintenance.  In physical spaces shared by more than one organization, ITS will try to work with all organizations to reach a mutually beneficial and agreeable arrangement for all.\nWhere possible, and when requested by departments/faculty, ITS will wireless-enable general purpose classrooms under our Manoa general purpose classroom support effort, on a best effort basis.\nRequests for assistance with planning for wireless networks can be made by calling the ITS Telecom office at: 956-6033.\nSelf-Supported: If an organization is installing and maintaining their own wireless devices, at a minimum, the device standards & configurations should be: 802.11b standards, configured to be \"closed\"  and WEP-enabled and preferably, support for LDAP and Radius.\nRadio Spectrum Management\nThere are many devices which share the same radio spectrum as the UH Wireless Network on the Manoa campus.  This includes, but is not limited to 2.4GHz cordless phones, wireless cameras or speakers which may interfere with the wireless network.   Also a wireless access point using the same frequency range as another unit may cause interference and degrade the quality of the wireless signal.  To prevent such disruptions on the UH Wireless Network, the use of other devices using the 2.4GHz frequency range are banned from areas that are now or may soon have wireless coverage. Non-2.4GHz alternatives are available for most of these other devices.  Also installation of self-supported data wireless access points must be coordinated with ITS to prevent frequency conflicts.\nSecurity\nThe wireless infrastructure should not be relied upon as being secure.  While a minimal level of security is provided through user authentication for ITS-managed wireless access points, application and data protection is still the responsibility of the application and data owners.\nFor departmentally deployed wireless networks, wireless access points should be configured to validate their identity (either using their UH Username or a departmental ID) to prevent unauthorized access of the network.\nShould ITS encounter a device that is interfering with the UH Manoa network infrastructure, ITS will attempt to notify the administrator on a time permitting basis but reserves the right to disconnect the device without notification.  ITS' first priority is to restore the network to its normal operating state.\nAny person attaching a wireless device to the UH Manoa Network is responsible for the security of the device and for any intentional or unintentional activities from or to the network pathway that the device is using.  Users and system administrators must guard against abuses that disrupt or threaten the network and any systems connected to it."

    "content": "Securing your data\n\nMost departments will either transfer or dispose of their old computers when they purchase new systems.  You will want to protect your documents with sensitive information from being exposed to others that may end up with your old system.  If you think that by deleting your files or reformatting your hard drive will be good enough then you should probably read the rest of this document.\n\nWhat is the difference between erase and delete?\n\nWhen you delete a file on a computer it is not actually removed from your hard drive.  The system just removes the record of the file’s existence from the part of the system that keeps track of where all of your files are located.  Think of it this way, you have a piece of paper that you wrote your name, address, phone number on and you decide to throw it in the trash can.  Is the information you wrote still on the paper?  When you empty the trash can and the garbage is dumped in a land-fill, is the information still on the paper?  Of course it is, just because you don't have access to it doesn’t mean that the information can’t be picked out of the trash and used by someone else.\nNow think of erase as a more permanent way of disposing your information.  It's similar to using a paper shredder or burning the paper.  It makes it a lot harder for someone to retrieve the information.  In a computer, eraser programs will write 1s and 0s over the file that you are trying to remove.  It will usually do this several times to make sure that the information is “shredded” from the hard drive.  Note that it is still possible to recover information after a single pass of erasing.\n \n\nWell I formatted my hard drive so my data is destroyed right?\n\nWRONG! Formatting your hard drive is similar to the delete command. It does not actually remove data from your hard drive. All formatting does is create a new file record table to keep track of the files you place on after the format is done.  This is the same for the FDISK utility. You can still retrieve the data until you actually write new files over the old data on the hard drive. \n\nAre there other ways of removing my data?\n\nYes, the first 2 options will destroy the hard drives (but it will be a permanent way of removing access to information on the hard drive). The 3rd option is a recommended way to erase the data and still use the computer. \n1)                  Physically destroying the drive. This is a good choice when your hard drive has failed, “crashed”. Remember that even though you can’t use the hard drive it still holds the information you put on it.  Hard drive’s can be disassembled and data can still be retrieved from the drive platters.  \n2)                  Degaussing the hard drive.  Degaussing will demagnetize the fields used to store data on the hard drive.  Usually when this method is used the magnetic field is so strong that the hard drive is damaged beyond use.\n 3)                It’s best to use an eraser program so others can still benefit by being able to use the computer.  Please review “Securely Deleting Electronic Information” for information on programs and procedures for erasing your files.  This document also has information on other electronic storage and devices that you may want to erase before disposal."

    "title": "UH File Drop",
    "content": "What is UH File Drop?\n\nUH File Drop is a service for the UH community for allowing transfer of large files (up to 999MB) to others in UH and/or people unaffiliated with the University. It is recognized that there is a growing need within the University community to share more and larger amounts of information with others. \nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop\n \n\nIs it secure?\n\nThe file transfer (both in uploading and downloading) is secure, in the sense that \"SSL\" is used to encrypt the file(s) over the Internet. This should provide sufficient security for most users. However, it's true that in the basic mode of operation, the security of the system depends entirely on the security of the randomly generated URLs used to download the files. It is extremely unlikely that anyone would be able to guess one of these URLs. But there may be other ways for an attacker to learn the download URL, and since in the basic mode of operation that's all we require to download the files, the attacker would gain access to the files.\n We do offer an additional level of protection, for users exchanging files containing sensitive information. When uploading files, you can check off the \"Optional Authentication\" checkbox. If this checkbox is selected, the UH user who is the recipient of the transfer (and in this case, the recipient must be a UH user) will have to login before retrieving the files. That is, the recipient must know both the secret URL and the recipient's UH Username and password.\n \n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe basic idea behind this service is simple: we allow people to upload potentially large files to our servers, where they will be stored for a limited period. We generate a random URL which can be used to download the files during that period. Once the files have been completely uploaded, we send an email containing this URL to the address or UH Username you have specified as the recipient. Note that the use of the service must comply with all relevant University policies, including E2.210.\nThis service is provided to the UH community, and is not meant to be open to the general public. However, we do wish to provide the ability for people unaffiliated with the University to use the service to share files with people within UH. In all cases, we require at least one end of the transaction (sender or receiver, that is) to be a UH person. The only practical consequence of this is that for a UH person to send files to a non-UH person, the UH person must use the link on the service home page to login prior to uploading files.\n \n\nStep by Step Upload of files\n\n\n    The sender must go the File Drop webpage to start the process.\n     \n    \n    Click on “login here” for UH users or type in your name and email address if you don’t have a UH Username.\n    \n     \n    \n    Type in the name and email address of the person that will receive your transferred file. You can also enter in any comments that you wish to pass on. An email with this information and URL will be sent to the person entered into this page. Press the Proceed button to continue.\n     \n    \n    Note that you can only enter one recipient name and email address. If you wish to send the same file to multiple people you can leave this page blank so that you can email to everyone at one time. This only works if you have logged in with a UH Username. More information is provided below.\n    \n     \n    \n    You will now select the file(s) from your local computer that will be uploaded to our UH File Drop site. Click on the Browse button to find and select the file(s) that you wish to upload. You can also put in a description of the file but this is optional. Note that you can enter up to three files to be transferred but the combined size of all three files must not exceed 999MB. You can setup multiple File Drops if you have more than three files. Just go through the steps again after you finish with this File Drop. Press the “Start Upload” button when you are done.\n    \n     \n    \n    Note the download page in the following screen. This is a randomly generated page and it is sent to the recipient you entered earlier. You can also copy this link and email it to others.\n     \n    \n    Copy the link on the page and open up your email program. Enter the people that you wish to receive the file information and in the body of your message paste the link you just copied then send the email when you are done.\n     \n    \n    Note that you can “Click here” if you have more files to upload to the UH File Drop. It will take you back to step 3.\n    \n     \n    \n\n\nStep by Step Download of Files\n\n\n    The File Drop service will send an email similar to the one below to the recipient that was entered during the upload process. Your email may look different if the sender sends a personal email.\n    \n     \n    \n    Click on the link at the bottom of the screen above. This should open your browser and display the following page. If the sender selected “Require authentication” you will need to login using your UH Username and password before you will see the following screen.\n     \n    \n    Click on the file name to begin the download process.\n     \n    \n     \n    \n    You can either save the file to your local computer or open it. I would suggest that you download the file before opening it. Remember that the file is only on the File Drop site for a short period of time before it is removed. \n     \n    \n    That completes the process of sending and receiving files using the UH File Drop service.\n     \n    \n\nYou can get more information by going to the FAQ webpage, http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop/help."

    "title": "Setting Up Encryption on macOS",
    "content": "If you have a need to store sensitive data such as social security numbers (SSNs) or student records on your Mac’s hard drive, you should make sure this data is encrypted. The following are two suggested methods for encrypting data on a Mac. Please be aware that forgetting the password you use to encrypt the data means you will no longer be able to access the data. There is no way around this, so proceed with caution.\nFileVault - Full Drive Encryption\nFileVault is the built-in full disk encryption solution offered by Apple. In addition to the security benefits of encryption, FileVault also enables: Needing a password to log in when your Mac is in sleep and after the screen saver; Only users with FileVault enabled can log in. All other users will need an administrator to log in first.\n\n    On your Mac, choose Apple menu > System Preferences\n    Click Security & Privacy\n    Click FileVault\n    Click the lock icon to unlock it, then enter an administrator name and password.\n    Click Turn On FileVault\n    Choose how to unlock your disk and reset your login password if you forget it:\n    \n        Use your iCloud account: Click Allow my iCloud account to unlock my disk.\n        Create a recovery key: Click \"Create a recovery key and do not use my iCloud account.\" Write down the recovery key and keep it in a safe place. If for some reason you forget your login password, the recovery key may allow you to recover your data.\n    \n    \n    Click Continue.\n    \n        If your Mac has additional users, their information is also encrypted. Users unlock the encrypted disk with their login password.\n        If there’s an Enable Users button, you must enter a user’s login password before they can unlock the encrypted disk. Click Enable Users, select a user, enter the login password, click OK, then click Continue.\n    \n    \n\nAdditional FileVault Resources\n\n    https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837\n    https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/encrypt-mac-data-with-filevault-mh11785/mac\n    https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/how-does-filevault-encryption-work-on-a-mac-flvlt001/10.15/mac/10.15\n\nSecure Disk Image - Container Encryption\nAn encrypted container is a location where you can store individual files, which will be encrypted. Apple refers to encrypted containers as a secure disk image (.dmg file), which is a file that looks and acts like a mountable device or volume.\n\n    In the Disk Utility app on your Mac, choose File > New Image > Blank Image.\n    Enter a filename for the disk image, add tags if necessary, then choose where to save it. This is the name that appears in the Finder, where you save the disk image file before opening it.\n    In the Name field, enter the name for the disk image. This is the name that appears on your desktop and in the Finder sidebar, after you open the disk image.\n    In the Size field, enter a size for the disk image.\n    Click the Format pop-up menu, then choose a format:\n    \n        If you're using the encrypted disk image with a Mac computer using macOS 10.13 or later, choose APFS or APFS (Case-sensitive).\n        If you're using the encrypted disk image with a Mac computer using macOS 10.12 or earlier, choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) or Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled).\n    \n    \n    Click the Encryption pop-up menu, then choose an encryption option.\n    Enter and re-enter a password to unlock the disk image, then click Choose.\n    \n        WARNING: If you forget this password, you won’t be able to open the disk image and view any of the files.\n    \n    \n    Use the default settings for the rest of the options:\n    \n        Click the Partitions pop-up menu, then choose Single partition - GUID Partition Map.\n        Click the Image Format pop-up menu, then choose “read/write” disk image.\n    \n    \n    Click Save, then click Done. Disk Utility creates the disk image file where you saved it in the Finder and mounts its disk icon on your desktop and in the Finder sidebar.\n    In the Finder, copy the documents you want to protect to the disk image.\n    If you want to erase the original documents so they can’t be recovered, drag them to the Trash, then choose Finder > Empty Trash.\n\nWhen not using your secure disk image, be sure to eject the secure disk image. This way, others with access to your computer will not be able to access these files.\nImportant: Be sure to record and keep this password in a safe place. You cannot access the data without this password.\nThe following Apple support article was used to provide the setup steps: https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/create-a-disk-image-dskutl11888/mac\nRemovable Media (e.g., CD/DVDs, USB Drives, and Memory Cards) - Full Drive Encryption\nWARNING: When you encrypt a disk or other media, the disk format is converted to the APFS format and then encrypted. Macs with older versions of macOS that don’t support the APFS format will not be able to read the device’s data.\n\n    In the Finder on your Mac, open a window, then Control-click the item you want to encrypt in the sidebar.\n    Choose Encrypt [item name] from the shortcut menu.\n    Create a password for the disk and click Encrypt Disk.\n\nImportant: Be sure to record and keep this password in a safe place. You cannot access the data without this password.\nTo decrypt an encrypted disk, Control-click the disk you want to decrypt, then choose Decrypt [item name] from the shortcut menu.\nThe following Apple support article was used to provide the setup steps: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/encrypt-disks-memory-cards-protect-mac-mh40593/mac. \nAn alternate method can be found here: https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/encrypt-protect-a-storage-device-password-dskutl35612/mac"

    "title": "Getting Your PC Unblocked on the UH Network",
    "content": "The following information pertains only to computers utilizing a Windows-based operating system that have become infected with a virus and that are on the UH Network.\nDetecting and Removing Viruses\nVirus infection is a common reason a computer can get blocked from the University of Hawaii network. A virus is defined as a program that was purposely designed to be loaded and run unknowingly on a computer. Some viruses (called worms) replicate themselves and spread to other computers using the network or via infected email messages. Computers are blocked from the network in order to prevent this from happening.\nPossible 'blocked' computer\nIf you previously have been able to get on the Internet, haven't made any changes to your computer network system, but find that you are unable to get to a web address using a browser while others in your office are able to do so, there is a possibility that your UH Username or Internet Protocol (IP) address might be blocked from the UH network. You may call the Information Technology Services (ITS) Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 from O'ahu, or (800) 558-2669 from the neighbor islands to check if this could be the case.\nVirus infected computer\nIf your computer is acting very sluggish or is randomly experiencing control problems, or if you have received email messages from friends saying that an email you sent them contained a virus, your computer may be infected with a virus. You should run through the following virus removal procedures to ensure that your computer is not a security risk.\nStinger\nThe McAfee Stinger program is a stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses found on computers today. Stinger is updated every couple of months to keep up-to-date with the newest viruses. You should always download the latest version. You can obtain an updated version of Stinger along with instructions on how to use the program from https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/downloads/free-tools/stinger.html.\nIf you do not have access to a computer with an Internet connection, you can walk into an ITS Lab and we will download the software for you. Please be sure to bring a USB flash drive.\nMcAfee Anti-virus\nThe University of Hawaii provides anti-virus software free to active University faculty, staff, or students with a valid UH Username and password. You can download the anti-virus software and instructions online from https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1254.\nPreventing Future PC Infections\nThis is probably the most important and overlooked step of cleaning a PC. The PC must be secured and patched to prevent future infections. If your PC is not secured you may be re-infected and blocked from using the UH network multiple times. If you have been blocked from using the UH network previously it will be more difficult to get your PC unblocked on successive network blockings.\nChange/create Passwords for Windows Computers\nIt is important to be sure that all of the accounts on your Windows computer have secure passwords. Insecure passwords can be easily guessed or obtained by automated guessing programs. A secure password is at a minimum six to eight characters long with at least one upper, one lower, one number and one special character. See Password Guidelines for tips on creating strong passwords.\nIf your PC is connected to a Windows domain, please contact your system administrator. For more information, see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-password\nChange your password on Windows 10\n\n    Click the Start button, click Settings, click Accounts.\n    Click Sign-in options\n    Under Password, Click Change\n    Enter your current password\n    Enter your new password twice along with a password hint, then click Next.\n    Click the Finish button to Change your password.\n\nWindows Updates and Patches\nWindows updates and patches are important for securing Windows PCs. Your computer may get infected or compromised if the Windows security patches are not up-to-date. To manually check for Windows updates:\nFor Windows 10\n\n    Select the Start  button, and then go to Settings  > Update & security  > Windows Update, and select Check for updates."

    "content": "The modern age of surfing the internet has produced many ways for unwanted email (spam) to get to you. Some are annoying by sending you unwanted information about a product being sold, but others more recently are highly invasive with potential of identity theft and fraudulent financial scams.\nSpam\nAny unsolicited (and usually commercial advertising) email is spam. However, this is very subjective. What might be \"spam\" to some, might be considered research to another. Spam sent to @hawaii.edu addresses is managed by Google's robust spam filter. Email messages that the filter deems highly likely to be spam will not be delivered to your mailbox and instead placed in the folder labeled \"Spam\" (or \"Gmail/Spam\" if using a mail client).  More information is available at the Spam at the University of Hawaii article.\nTo minimize the amount of spam that you receive (information taken from the Federal Trade Commission):\n\n    Try not to display your email address in public, such as on websites, newsgroups, and your online service's membership directory.\n    Check the privacy policy when you submit your address to a website.\n    Read and understand the entire form before you transmit personal information through a website.\n    Decide if you want to use two email addresses - one for personal messages and the other for newsgroups and chat rooms.\n    Use an email filter.\n\nPhishing\nPhishing (pronounced \"fishing\") is an Internet scam that uses spam or pop-up messages to deceive you into disclosing your credit card numbers, bank account information, Social Security number, passwords, or other sensitive information. The messages appear to be from legitimate organizations such as banks, credit unions, and online shopping sites asking you to verify your personal information. Generally, these messages state that if you do not update or verify your information, your account will be canceled or deleted. The intent will be to use your credit card or financial accounts for their personal purposes, leaving you with the bills and highly time-consuming job of sorting out a bad credit rating.\nTo avoid getting hooked by a phishing scam:\nNEVER respond to these types of email by clicking on the web link in the email message and entering your personal information, and DON'T reply to the message either.\nThese are the guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission:\n\n    If you get an email or pop-up message that asks for personal or financial information, do not reply or click on the link in the message. Legitimate companies don't ask for this information via email.\n    Don't email personal or financial information.\n    Review credit card and bank account statements as soon as you receive them.\n    Use anti-virus software and keep it up to date.\n    Be cautious about opening any attachment or downloading any files from emails you receive, regardless of who sent them.\n\nWhat to do...\nIf you obtain spam from an @hawaii.edu account, you can report it to uhabuse@hawaii.edu.\nIf it's not from an @hawaii.edu account:\n\n    report suspicious activity to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/ or 1-877-382-4357.\n    If you get spam that is phishing for information, forward it to spam@uce.gov.\n    If you believe you've been scammed, file your complaint at https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/, then visit the FTC's Identity Theft Web site at https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/Steps to learn how to minimize your risk of damage from ID theft.\n    If you receive a porn spam (pornography), you can report it to FTC https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/. It should also be reported back to the ISP (Internet Service Provider) where the email originated from.\n\nPhishing notification\nPlease go to http://www.hawaii.edu/its under the Security Alerts section to check for the latest phishing attacks targeting UH usernames.\nIf you would like to receive phishing notices by email, go to http://www.hawaii.edu/its/notices/index.php and subscribe to our phishing alert email list."

File transfer protocal (ftp) clients such as (WS_FTP LE and Fetch 3.x - 4.x) no longer work with our services, as these programs do not support encryption.\n \n\n    \n        \n            Platform:\n            Protocol:\n            Application: (click to download)\n            Installation Instructions\n        \n        \n            PC\n            SSH\n            PuTTY 0.73\n            HTML\n        \n        \n            PC\n            SFTP\n            FileZilla\n            HTML\n        \n        \n            Macintosh OS X 10.9 and higher\n            SFTP\n            FileZilla\n            \n            HTML\n            \n        \n    \n\n\nWhichever sftp client you choose to use when uploading your Web content, remember to include the port number, which is 22, when connecting. This number comes after the host name when opening a sftp connection to the Web server. For instance, when connecting to uhunix, the host name should look like uhunix.hawaii.edu:22. Use this host name along with your uhunix username and password when creating a sftp connection to publish webpages. \n \nFor more information, please visit the SSH/SSL FAQ.\nTroubleshooting\n\n    If you have trouble uploading your files, send mail to help@hawaii.edu\n    If your error message says the file is not readable, the directory is not readable, or permission denied, then use the Personal Homepage Management Utility to make your file(s) viewable.\n    If you get an error messsage saying that the file is not found, be sure you have an 'index.html' file in your public_html subdirectory. You can use the Personal Homepage Management Utility to create a default (index.html) page in the correct place or make sure your SFTP general settings are correct.\n    If your error message states that the host is not found, be sure you type your URL correctly.\n    Make sure that you include the port number for you sftp connection. For example, when connecting to uhunix use uhunix.hawaii.edu:22. \n\nScripting and ASP Info\nCGI scripting (other than features listed below), Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP), and Microsoft Extensions are not supported on MyHomepages.

    "title": "Tips to Create a Strong and Secure Password",
    "content": "The days of using simple words, a single character, or a blank password are gone. Today, easy passwords can be cracked or guessed within hours or even minutes. Since the information on your computer is precious and potentially confidential, you need to protect it as much as you can. This guide is to help you create strong and solid passwords that will serve as a roadblock for intruders who are trying to break-in to your computer or online accounts.\n\n    Length – The number of characters for your password is very important. The recommended number of characters are at least eight characters (a UH Username password is required to be 8-32 characters). A three character password such as fgy can easily be guessed by an intruder (or a password cracking program) much more quickly  than an eight character password such as 10RvR09$.\n     \n    Strength – The strength of a password refers to the complexity of the password. In other words, can anyone guess what your password is? For example, if your computer account is janedoe and your password is janedoe or JaneDoe, an intruder can easily try and succeed in logging into your computer. You should not use words that can be traced to you such as your address, pet name, spouse name, surname, nickname, and should not use any words contained in dictionaries in any languages.\n    \n    To strengthen your password, the recommendation is to use a mix of special characters, numbers, and the alphabet (a UH Username password requires one upper case character, one lower case character, one number, and one special character). Special characters are !@#$%^&*()_+{}. Here are a few examples of stronger passwords: uRkn2T@ or R24Real? or Yc@nU95.\n     \n    Keywords – Most people are familiar with creating simple temporary passwords for new employees or for other trusted people with the intent on allowing them to change the password at a later time. Passwords like abc123 and 567fgh were commonly used. If you use or ever used this method, you should break this habit. These passwords are almost like not having a password because intruders have programmed these words into their software to guess your password. The recommended practice is to assign a strong password from the beginning so that the new employee or trusted colleague will also follow your lead.\n     \n    Historical – It is not a good practice to create four or five passwords and switch between them every time the computer reminds you to change your password. It would defeat the purpose of having a life span for the passwords. For example:\n    \n    start – my password is Tr*2catchmE! \n    45 days later– I change my password to U#can’tGetIN% \n    45 days later – I change my password to Wht$Up23& \n    45 days later – I change my password back to the starting password Tr*2catchmE!\n    \n    Do not just add on more characters to your existing password such as Tr*2catchmE!456. If the intruder guessed the first part of the password, they would just need to guess the last three characters.\n    \n    Be creative. You should not recycle passwords! This is one resource that you are allowed to waste.\n     \n    One for All – Avoid re-using passwords across multiple accounts/services. Keeping track of passwords for different accounts can be difficult. It is very convenient to create a strong password and use it for all your accounts for your credit card company website, your home Internet service provider, your work computer, or your personal email accounts like Hotmail or Yahoo. However, this is a bad habit and you should never do this. Let’s say that you have 14 accounts with a variety of Web sites or email sites. An intruder breaks into one of those companies who offer these services. The intruder now has your password for all 14 accounts and will have an easy time gaining access to those accounts. The recommended practice is to have unique passwords for each account. This means that you will have 14 different passwords if we use the previous example. This way the intruder will not be able to take over all of your accounts.\n     \n    Previously Exposed – When attempting to gain access to online accounts via brute force, malicious actors use a \"dictionary\" of compromised passwords that they know have been previously or commonly used. Whenever a data breach occurs for any service, the number of entries in their \"dictionary\" grows. It is recommended to never use a password that has been previously exposed in a data breach - even if it the password was never associated with your email address or one of your accounts. The website https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords provides an easy way to check whether or not a given password has been previously exposed.\n\nOther password-related security tips are:\n\n    Do NOT share your passwords with anyone!  They *could* easily misuse your account or give your password to someone else.\n     \n    \n    If you do login to your account using a public, shared computer (like in a net cafe or public library) change your password later using a safe,secure computer.  The public computer may be infected with a keystroke logger that can record your account and password that can be used by spammers and hackers.\n     \n    \n    Do NOT post your password on your computer monitor, any where on your desk, under your keyboard, or in other commonly accessible areas.\n\nThis guide was created to make you aware of the consequences of using weak or blank passwords and not to make cause undue concern or anxiety. Remember that your password is your key into unlocking your computer and it is comparable to a car key unlocking your car door. Creating strong password is one of the easiest security tools to keep your accounts and information safe.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA)\nFor added security, consider enrolling in UH's Multi-Factor Authentication service, Duo. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an extra layer of protection on top of your UH Username and password. When MFA is enabled, UH Login requires two factors for a successful login. The first factor is what we commonly do today, sign-in with the UH Username and password. The second factor requires authentication through a device (e.g. smartphone or landline) to login. Using these multiple factors provides increased security to your UH account information.\nMFA can decrease the risk of an account compromise since UH Login would require more than just the UH Username and password for authentication. To enable MFA, simply register a device; you will be prompted for the second factor using the registered device when logging into any service or application using UH Login authentication.\nMFA is offered, free of charge, to all students, faculty, and staff at the University of Hawai'i. Mobile device service charges may apply.\nFor more information or to register your device, visit https://www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin/.\nFor MFA FAQs, visit https://www.hawaii.edu/its/faq-topics/mfa-faq/"

    "title": "Securely Deleting Electronic Information",
    "content": "In today's digital age, we routinely store personal and sensitive information such as our banking and tax information, addresses and phone numbers, and photos on a variety of magnetic storage media. Traditional media includes computer hard drives, USB flash drives, CD-ROMs, and DVDs. \"Lifestyle\" devices such as smart phones (iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, etc.), mobile entertainment devices (iPods and MP3 players) are extremely versatile and are also being used to send/receive email and attachments, take/store photos, keep lists of names/addresses/phone numbers – all of which can be considered personal or sensitive information. Other types of storage are Compact Flash, Memory Stick cards, and Secure Digital (SD) memory cards.\n\n\nTo prevent your information from being misused, care should be taken to ensure that any personal or sensitive information is securely deleted especially before recycling or disposing of any such devices or storage media. This document provides an overview on how to securely delete information from commonly used electronic devices. The first section describes methods that can be used for equipment that will be re-used or recycled (given or sold to someone else for further use). The second section describes secure deletion methods that should be used if the equipment is to be permanently disposed of (not re-used).\n\n\nWhy \"DELETE\" is not enough:\nUsing a computer's standard \"delete\" function is not sufficient to permanently erase sensitive information. When you delete a file or folder using the \"Recycle Bin\" or \"Trash\", your operating system simply flags the contents of the file/folder to be overwritten and re-used in the future. Until that space is overwritten, the contents of the file still exist on the media and can be recovered with disk/file recovery tools that are readily found on the Internet. With today's large hard drives, the contents of these \"deleted\" files can remain, unchanged, on the media for a very long time.\nSection 1 – Equipment will be recycled:\nTo securely erase the information, it must be overwritten. The more times the information is overwritten, the less likely it can be recovered. However, the more times you overwrite the information, the longer the process will take. This process is called \"disk wiping\" or \"disk shredding.\" It is recommended that the higher the sensitivity or confidentiality of the information, the more times the information should be overwritten.\n\n\nThere are commercial, shareware, and free disk wiping tools. Some tools will allow you to delete individual files or folders and others will erase an entire hard drive. While there are freeware tools that perform well, these may require a more technical understanding of computers to use them properly. Commercial products tend to be easier to use and understand. Please read the instructions thoroughly for the tool that you select. The files/folders you delete will be permanently erased and cannot be recovered. If you are unsure of how to use your selected tool or don't know which tool to use, please seek assistance from a knowledgeable source.\n\n\nIf you are recycling a computer or device, securely erasing the entire hard drive is recommended. Be aware that doing so will also erase the operating system requiring a complete re-installation of the operating system before the computer can be used again.\n\n\nWindows OS: \nEraser is highly rated free tool for any computer using the Windows operating system. This tool works well to delete individual files and folders that contain sensitive or personal information that you no longer need. Eraser can be downloaded from: https://eraser.heidi.ie/download/\n \nTo erase an entire hard drive, a recommended free tool is Darik's Boot and Nuke (DBAN): http://dban.sourceforge.net/\n\n\nWith this tool, you'll need to create a bootable USB flash drive or CD, then boot your computer. The application will launch automatically and you'll need to specify which partition or hard drive that you'd like erased.\n\n\nYou can also see Microsofts article about safetly disposing of computers for more information on data erasure: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/safely-dispose-computers-and-devices.aspx\n\n\nA list of free tools is available at: http://www.thefreecountry.com/security/securedelete.shtml\n\n\nMacintosh Computers: \nMac computer hard drives can be securely erased by zeroing their data. The Apple site provides step-by-step instructions for securely erasing from within macOS using Disk Utility. Note that securely erasing may take a long time, depending on the size of the hard drive.\n \nMore detailed information for Macs can be found at the following links:\n\n    \n    Disk Utility for macOS Sierra: Erase a volume using Disk Utility https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22241\n    \n    \n    For a general search of the the Apple Knowledge Base, go to: https://support.apple.com.\n    \n\nIn previous versions of macOS, you were able to securely delete items in the trash through the “Secure Empty Trash” command in the Finder to ensure that deleted files were overwritten. This feature has been deprecated in current versions of macOS due to hardware limitations in modern solid state drives (SSD). To limit access deleted items and documents, you may want to encrypt your device. You can find out about more about macOS encryption at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837\nSection 2: Equipment will be disposed of (destroyed):\nDegaussing is a permanent method to securely delete information from most magnetic storage devices. Degaussing is a process by which the storage media is subjected to a very powerful magnetic field which demagnetizes the media and renders it permanently unusable. Degaussing is most commonly used with inoperable hard drives and magnetic tapes in large enterprise environments. The price of a low-end degausser starts at approximately $3000. Working hard drives in computers should be erased with a tool such as the above mentioned DBAN before disposing of the computer. \nHowever, most modern computers use solid state drives (SSDs) and do not rely on magnetic plates to store data. For these types of drives, degaussing would not erase the data within them. The most effective way to erase data from SSDs would be to reformat them or physically destroy them.\nPhysical Destruction: \nCommercial services are available to physically shred hard disks. Tapes can be unwound from the spools. The magnetic media can then be physically cut into pieces such as running it through a shredder. The same types of services are also available for solid state drives: they can be crushed and shredded.\nWrite-Once Media (CDs. DVDs):\nCDs and DVDs that can only be written to once (also called CD-R, or DVD-R), must be physically destroyed preferably by running it through paper shredders that are also rated for shredding CDs and credit cards.\nCell Phones:\nFor information on how to delete all your information from your cell phone before recycling or disposing of it, check with your cell phone manufacturer."

RIOs may  download an ITS Username Request form here: www.hawaii.edu/help/accounts/deptaccts.html. Space will not be allocated to any organizations outside of the  University.\nAlso note that departmental Web sites on UHINFO must meet the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines for accessibility for people with disabilities. Please see Assistive Technology and Accessibility for People with Disabilities\n\nQuestions\n\n    When should our department consider putting a document or database on the central UHINFO servers?\n    When should our department consider putting information on a local (departmental) server?\n    We want to create a server for our department, where can we get advice?\n    We want to create and maintain a departmental Web page, but not run our own server. Can we do that?\n    Our campus organization/student group already has a server, how can it be added to the server list?\n    How do I get more information about putting data (but not maintaining our own Web pages) on the central UHINFO servers?\n\n\nAnswers\n1. When should our department or organization consider putting a document or database on the central UHINFO servers?\nYou may consider putting up information on these servers when:\n\n    Information is so popular that the number of people consulting it might overwhelm your local network; or\n    Information is so critical to campus functions that it needs to be reliably available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; or\n    Information is of interest to the whole campus, but the department doesn't have a network or any way to support a server.\n\n2. When should our department consider putting information on a local (departmental) server?\nThis option may be better for your department if:\n\n    The department wants its own special hostname (e.g., www.history.hawaii.edu).\n    The department wants a lot of local control over the look and feel of the information, and values the flexibility and convenience of managing updates directly; or\n    Information is of primary interest to the department; or\n    Information is of wide interest, but the number of people consulting it can be handled by the local network and server; or\n    The department has a lot of information and wants to create a Web structure to tie it all together; and\n    The department has its own personnel available to maintain the server.\n\n3. We want to create a server for our department, where can we get advice?\nThere is an ever increasing number of books, courses, and online resources that are available to help you get started. For smaller Web sites, a simple Windows or Macintosh computer will be adequate.\n \n4. We want to create and maintain a departmental Web page, but not run  our own server. Can we do that?\nHere are some options:\n\n    (preferred) Department faculty or staff who are willing to maintain their department's information may request space on the ITS server. Please see How to Get your Information into UHINFO for the necessary information.\n    You can create your own pages in your home directory on uhunix following the same instructions for creating personal home pages.\n    You can request a departmental uhunix ID from the Help Desk, then create your own pages in this home directory by following the same instructions for creating personal home pages.\n\nIf you need help in writing HTML, there is a small sampling of the online resources to assist in Web creation linked to UHINFO.\nPerhaps the best advice would be to go out and explore other servers to find out which features you like and dislike before working on your own pages.\nOnce you have some of that set up, you may want to contact webhead@hawaii.edu to discuss other viable options like putting it up on a different server.\n \n5. Our campus organization/student group already has a server, how can it be added to the server list?\nSend an email message to webhead@hawaii.edu with such details as the:\n\n    the server's Uniform Resource Locator (URL)\n    a short description of your organization's server\n    what department or organization is  responsible  for  maintaining the server, and\n    email address for the server's administrator\n\n6. How do I get more information about putting data (but not maintaining our own Web pages) on the central UHINFO servers?\nThere are several ways to submit information to UHINFO:\n\n    For one time events, go to the UH Events Calendar and click on the \"Add an Event\" button at the bottom.\n    For on-going information, send an email message to webhead@hawaii.edu who will be happy to discuss it in more detail."

    "title": "Getting Started with Departmental Pages",
    "content": "As a UH Department, your staff can have access to the Information Technology Services (ITS) Web servers for putting departmental information online.\nGetting Space\nThe recommended method for doing this is to have someone in the department who is already familiar with creating Web pages to be authorized to log into the ITS Web server and upload your department's pages into a specific directory. In brief, here are the steps to take:\n\n    You can request your department website at https://www.hawaii.edu/its/webservice/front.php\n    Have the name and UH Username of the person who will be responsible for uploading/maintaining your department's data\n    Think of a name for your department's directory that will be created. It should be short and concise; the URL will be of the form <campus>.hawaii.edu/directoryname/ so the shorter the better. Examples of these might be manoa.hawaii.edu/ar/ for Admissions and Records and manoa.hawaii.edu/its/ for Information Technology Services.\n    This request must come from UH faculty or staff; students may not request space for a department.\n    Note: If you require more than one person to maintain the department's pages, you may provide up to three Usernames.\n\nPlease Note: Due to security reasons, we are only allocating space on our Web server to University departments. Exceptions may be made to Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs) if they have special programming needs. Otherwise, we encourage RIOs to use the free Web space allocated with their ITS Usernames for their webpage. RIOs may request an Organizational UH Username. Space will not be allocated to any organizations outside of the University.\nCreating Your Pages\nThere are tons of ways to create your pages. You can learn HTML by taking a beginner's class (check with the Outreach College), getting a book, or by purchasing software (go to the UH Bookstore). We recommend obtaining an HTML Editor software program for your computer such as Macromedia Dreamweaver by Adobe. HTML Editors work like basic word processing programs that can save your work as an HTML page suitable for the Web.\nUploading Your Pages to the ITS Web Server\nThe last thing to do is to upload your files to the ITS Web server so they will be available on the Internet for all to see.\nYou can use any free \"SFTP\" software to upload your website files. You can obtain free SSH software. You can also download these off the Internet or from other sources. Check with the ITS Help Desk for more information.\nYou will need to know the correct login ID and password, which directory you will put your information into, and the hostname of the computer you'll connect to. The webmaster will provide this information to you upon approval of your request for Web space.\nTIPS\nA few tips that might be useful:\n\n    A more useful website is not a \"who we are\" kind of site, but rather one that contains information that is really useful to the audience, like the kinds of programs or courses offered; descriptions of events that are being sponsored; tips on studying; instructions for getting into a program; and so forth.\n    If you feel uncomfortable with the technology, it might make sense to hire a good student assistant who can be responsible for your department's website (under your supervision, of course). Most students nowadays are very computer literate and have seen a lot of webpages to have some idea of what can be done. With the proper tools and some guidance, the student can often do a fantastic job."

    "title": "Browser Recommendations for ITS-Supported Web Applications",
    "content": "Browser Recommendations\nThe following browser recommendations are for ITS-supported web applications and are based on coordinated testing efforts between the ITS Help Desk and the developers for various ITS-supported web applications. Because of the rapid changes to modern web browsers, please check the matrices of test results for Windows browsers and Mac OS browsers frequently, as browser test results will be posted as soon as they are available.\nWindows Browser Matrix\nmacOS Browser Matrix\nMicrosoft Edge\nMicrosoft Edge is included with Windows 10 and higher, and it can be updated via Windows Updates. ITS supports the versions included with the currently supported Windows versions.\n\n    Windows OS Information\n    Microsoft Edge\n\nSafari\nSafari is included with macOS and can be updated through the Mac App Store. ITS supports the versions included with the currently supported macOS versions.\n\n    macOS Information\n    Updating Safari\n\nChrome\nThe latest version of Google Chrome and the version immediately preceding it are supported by ITS. See Chrome Releases blog for details on the current version.\nChrome 45 and later does not support NPAPI plugins, such as Java, Silverlight, and Flash.\n\n    System Requirements\n    Download Latest Version\n    Updating Google Chrome\n\nFirefox\nITS supports the latest version of Firefox and the version immediately preceding it. Additionally, support is provided for the latest ESR release.\nAs of version 52 and later, Firefox does not support NPAPI plugins such as Java and Silverlight.\n\n    System Requirements (Latest Release)\n    System Requirements (ESR)\n    Download Latest Release\n    Download Latest ESR\n    Updating Firefox\n\nFactors for Recommendations\nWhile individual users and departments may have specific browser preferences, the recommendations are based on many factors:\n\n    Testing\n         Recommendations are the result of extensive testing, when possible, and reflect what works best for each application. ITS does not favor a particular browser and recommends what provides the best user experience.     \n    Manufacturer support\n         Some applications are purchased externally, so recommendations and requirements come directly from the manufacturer. For example, the Peoplesoft and Banner systems have specific browser recommendations that are not set by ITS.     \n    Operating System\n         Operating systems may come with a specific browser version pre-installed and recommendations will not go backwards to lower versions. For example, Windows 7 comes with IE 8, so recommendations are for that version or higher. Note also that browsers can run differently under various operating systems. Thus, recommendations vary depending on the OS.     \n    Range and number of users.\n         The ITS Help Desk provides support to all University users. With the broad range and large number of users across the system, it is necessary at some point to discontinue support for older/out-dated browser versions and stay up-to-date with newer releases.     \n    Consistency\n         The ITS Help Desk also provides support for many applications across the system and every application, whether developed in-house or purchased externally, has unique requirements. The recommendations aim to provide consistency for users such that upgrading does not adversely affect the use of other applications. Therefore, recommendations are not always for the most current browser versions and ITS may not be able to provide definitive recommendations for current versions until full testing across applications is complete. The matrices will indicate when partial, but not comprehensive, testing has been done for a browser version to provide the best available results at any given time.      \n    Helpful Tips\n    \n        Upgrading\n             Before upgrading your operating system or browser, consult with the ITS Help Desk to verify that upgrading will not adversely affect the applications you use.     \n        Version numbers\n             Browser versions can be very specific. Version numbers reflect changes to the browser's code, either because new features have been added or updates have been included to fix previous bugs. If you experience problems, make sure you are running a version that is properly supported.     \n        Use what works\n             The recommendations provided are what the ITS Help Desk currently supports and has tested. In some cases, applications may work using versions not listed in the browser matrices. However, if you experience problems with versions not listed in the browser matrices, the Help Desk will encourage the use of supported and tested browser versions."

We wish to retain the ability to publish pages for our users and we intend to do so by informing our users of the basic policies and by obtaining their cooperation.\nBelow are some of the more prominent points to remember regarding the computing policies:\nResponsibility for Content\nThe content of all the UH Personal Home Pages is solely the responsibility of the individual authors; UH Information Technology Services (ITS), the University of Hawaii (UH), and the State of Hawaii are not responsible for its content. ITS will not monitor content except if it becomes necessary to investigate complaints or allegations that such content violates federal, state, or local laws or University of Hawaii policies.\nITS, UH, and the State of Hawaii are also not responsible for the content of every page accessible from the UH Personal Home Pages (i.e., external links).\nAll policies which apply to the university's computing and network resources (including the Executive Policy Use and Management of Information Technology Resources and the Student Conduct Code) apply to the UH Personal Home Pages. These shall include the following:\n\n    No illegal material (which may include sexually explicit/offensive images or sounds, and copyrighted or licensed material)\n    No pages created for commercial purposes\n    No deliberate acts which waste computing resources or which unfairly monopolize resources to the exclusion of others\n\nAny violation of these policies may result in the incident being brought before the Dean of Students and/or University of Hawaii legal entities for disciplinary action.  \nAppropriate Content\nDue to inherent limitations of the the Personal Home Pages (20MB storage space limit, lack of content support, no non-HTML language support), we recommend that Perosnal Home Pages be used for personal purposes. However, a user may host academic class materials or other materials/information for academic purposes if they wish. A faculty or staff member who requires functionality beyond the scope of what the Personal Home Pages offers should use departmental web space and not the Personal Home Page service. Faculty and staff should contact their departmental IT Specialist for web space on their official college/department Web server.\nMr/Ms (Over) Popularity\nBecause the UH Personal Home Pages is a shared resource, it is an inappropriate place to offer any service (whether it be commercial or otherwise) that is likely to attract a large volume of network traffic from the Internet. ITS may investigate any pages that are generating an abnormal amount of traffic.\nCreating Personal Homepages\nTo get started, or for more information on how to create your own personal homepage, please visit the following article: Creating Personal Homepages."

    "content": "The following steps will setup an automated vacation message for your Google@UH Gmail account.  This vacation message will be sent in response to any incoming email messages you receive during the time period specified.\n\n    Open your web browser to Google@UH Gmail.\n    Login to your Google@UH email account with your UH username and password.\n    Click the gear icon  in the upper right, then select Settings.\n    \n    Figure 1 - Gmail Settings Menu\n    In the General tab, scroll down to the Vacation responder: section. Select Vacation responder on .\n    Enter the starting date and ending date in the appropriate First Day: and Last Day: boxes.\n    Enter the subject and body of your message in the corresponding Subject: and Message: boxes. \n    \n    Figure 2 - Sample Vacation Responder Settings\n    [Optional] Check the box next to Only send a response to people in my Contacts if you don't want everyone who emails you to know that you're away from your mail.\n    [Optional] If you use Google Apps, you'll also see an option to only send a response to people in the University of Hawaii (hawaii.edu). If you check both of these boxes, only people who are in your contacts and your domain will receive the automatic response.\n    Click Save Changes button.\n\nNotes\nYour vacation responder starts at 12:00 AM on the start date (First Day) and ends at 11:59 PM on the end date (Last Day), unless you end it earlier.\nIn general, your reply is only sent once to people who email you. However, if the same person contacts you again after four days and your vacation responder is still on, Gmail will send another vacation response to remind the person that you're away from your email. Your vacation response will start over each time you edit it, so if someone receives your initial vacation response, and then emails you again after you've edited the subject or body of the message, he or she will receive the edited response.\nMessages classified as spam and messages addressed to a mailing list you subscribe to will not receive a vacation response.\nExcerpts from http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=25922\nTips\n\n    Test your vacation message before leaving on vacation, preferably when you don't receive a lot of email.\n    \n        Temporarily change the start date to the current day (of testing).\n        Save changes.\n        Send yourself a test message.\n        If all is well, reset vacation option to proper start date and save changes.\n    \n    \n    You could have a pre-defined \"away from my email\" message saved but have Vacation responder off.\n    \n        On your last day to check email regularly, set Vacation Responder on.\n        Ensure that your start and end dates are correct.\n        Save your changes."

    "content": "This document is intended to assist University of Hawai‘i departments who wish to dispose of computer equipment that may still be useful to others. These guidelines are not intended to replace any Administrative Procedures, so be sure to consult with your Administrative Officer (AO) or Fiscal Officer (FO) for specific procedures to facilitate the disposal.\nBefore initiating any disposal effort, you must verify ownership using the state decal number (or serial number if no decal is found) against the departmental inventory records. If the item cannot be found on the inventory records, it may be necessary for your AO or FO to research the original purchase before the disposal process can begin.\nPROTECT YOUR INFORMATION\nBefore donating or recycling a computer you should erase all files containing personal information. Simply deleting files isn’t enough; you should overwrite the disc files. UH Information Technology Services (ITS) has compiled tips for “Securely Deleting Electronic Information.”\nDISPOSAL OF UH-OWNED EQUIPMENT BY TRANSFER\nThe preferred method of disposing of computer equipment is to find another University department, state department, or agency that can use the equipment.\n\n    First, send out email or internal memos to see if there is anyone within your department or college that would want the equipment.\n    \n    If no one within your unit is interested, advertise the item on the UH Electronic Swap Meet.\n    Before adding your notice, be sure to search the current database of available or wanted items to see if anyone has already posted a request for a similar item. (You may also click the button on the right side of the main page to be added to an email list that will notify you when new items are added to the Swap Meet database.)\n    \n    Contact the State of Hawaii Surplus Property Branch at (808) 831-6757, or other state departments or agencies you know of that may have use for the equipment.\n\nIf another University unit agrees to the equipment, have your department Administrative Officer (AO) or Fiscal Officer (FO) process in KFS (Kuali Financial Systems).\n\nDISPOSAL OF UH-OWNED EQUIPMENT BY DONATION\nIf there is no department interested in your surplus equipment, the organizations listed below will accept used computers and peripherals to be placed in schools or other non-profit areas. While newer, working equipment is preferred, older or non-working pieces may also be accepted. In all cases, notify your AO or FO prior to finalizing your donation.\nWhile we have made a best effort to provide a comprehensive list that includes current contact information please contact ITS if you encounter an outdated link or have additional options to share.\n\n    Hawaiian Hope is a tech repair and reuse organization.  Uses donated hardware to provide technology service to other non-profit organizations, homeless, low income families, veterans and students. Full Hard Drive Wiping done on all computers. Volunteers Accepted.\n    The Freecycle Network is a nonprofit Yahoo Groups’ movement of people who are offering items for free in their own towns. Membership is free; use the list at your own risk. http://www.freecycle.org\n    Friends of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (Volcano, HI) accepts donations primarily on a need basis. They are a 501(c)3, not-for-profit organization. Donations are either brought to the office in the Volcanoes National Park, or picked up by a volunteer close to your area. For more information, contact ainahou2@aol.com or (808) 985-7373.\n    National Cristina Foundation gives computer equipment and software a second productive life by placing these technology resources with charities, schools, and public agencies, to provide training to students at risk, the economically disadvantaged, and people with disabilities. Email: ncf@cristina.org  Phone: 1-800-274-7846\n    The Arc in Hawaii is a 501(c)3 non-profit that provides residential and day services to men and women with intellectual disabilities. Residences are distributed throughout Oahu; day services are provided at Ruger, Pearl City and Wahiawa. The Arc accepts donations of older generation computers capable of running industry standard software that assures the level of security required for HIPPA compliance.

The law requires that manufacturers of computers, monitors, and printers sold in the State must take back and recycle their products; retailers are only required to take back their in-house store brands. In 2011, the law added television sets to the mandatory electronics recycling equipment list. A list of approved manufacturers' plans, list of Hawaii eWaste collectors, and details concerning the new law are available on the State of Hawaii Department of Health Electronic Device and Television Recycling Law webpage.\nADDITIONAL SOURCES OF RECYCLING INFORMATION\n\n    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Electronics Recycling Centers Finder\n    County of Hawai‘i – Department of Environmental Management\n    Ph: (808) 961-8083\n    Free residential ewaste collection takes place on Saturdays, on a rotating basis, at four island Recycling & Transfer Stations, from 9:00am to 4:00pm.

The UH VPN allows you to become part of the UH network from anywhere.\n\nWhy should I use the UH VPN?\nAccess to the UH VPN is only necessary if it is required by a specific institutional application (such as PeopleSoft or STAR). Check with your application administrator if you require access to the application from a non-UH network.  They will tell you if you need to use the UH VPN.   Most general applications (UH email, Laulima, etc.) should be accessible without having to use the UH VPN.\n\nHow do I get access?\nYou will need:\n1)  Your UH Username and password (and you must be currently affiliated with UH)\n2)  A Windows, Macintosh, iOS, or Android device that is connected to a network and configured to use the UH VPN\n\nSpecific details on using the UH VPN can be found at:  http://www.hawaii.edu/its/vpn/\n\nPlease note that use of the VPN requires some knowledge of configuring the network settings of your computer."

    "content": "ITS has a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server available for use by the UH community.  For faculty and staff directory listings, a public search of the ITS LDAP directory from your email client might be useful when you need to send a message and you know the person's name, but not their email address.  [Note: due to privacy issues, no students are included in the LDAP server.]\nLDAP works better in some email clients than others.  At the time this article was written, LDAP seems to work best in Thunderbird (PC and Macintosh), or Mac Mail. Please note that the more information you provide in the search fields the better and faster your results will be. However, we do not recommend searching by anything other than first name, last name, both first and last, or username. If your search comes up empty try searching a different way.\nThe following are instructions on setting up the ITS supported email clients to use the UH LDAP.\nThunderbird 2.0 and higher (Windows and Macintosh)\nSetup \n \n\n    Go to the Tools menu and select Account Settings.\n    On the left side, click on Composition & Addressing.\n    On the right, select Use a different LDAP server, then click on Edit directories.\n    Click on Add.\n    Fill out the screen as follows: \n    Name: UH LDAP \n    Hostname: ldap1.its.hawaii.edu \n    Base DN: ou=people,dc=hawaii,dc=edu\n    Click OK. Click OK again, and then click OKone more time.\n    Close Thunderbird and then reopen it for the new settings to take effect.\n\n\nUsage\n \n\n    Create a new message.\n    Click on the Contacts button a search field will come up. (Or enable the Contacts pane in newer versions of Thunderbird)\n    Select the UH LDAP address book from the Address Book: drop down.\n    You may type a combination of first name, last name, or part of first name/part of last name in the Search For: field provided.\n    Thunderbird will display a list of choices. Click on the correct choice and it will be inserted into your message.\n\nOptionally you can click on the address book icon to perform a search.\n  \nOutlook 2007 and higher for Windows\nSetup \n \n\n    Go to the Tools menu and select Account settings. (In newer versions of Outlook this can be found under the File tab)\n    If this is the first time you are doing this, you might be asked if you want to synchronize your RSS feeds.  Click Yes unless you are sure you don't want to.\n    Click on the Address Books tab.  Click New.\n    Select Internet Directory Service (LDAP).  Click Next.\n    In the \"Server name\" box, type ldap1.its.hawaii.edu\n    Click on More settings.  You will be prompted that it will not be active until you exit and restart Outlook.  Click OK.\n    Click on the Search tab.  In the \"Search base\" box, select Custom, then in the box type: ou=people,dc=hawaii,dc=edu \n    Click OK.  Click Next.  Click Finish.  Click Close.\n\n\nUsage \n \n\n    Create a new mail message\n    Click on To... \n    Under the \"Address Book\" option, select ldap.hawaii.edu \n    Click on Advanced Find \n    Type a first and/or last name in the appropriate box, and click OK. Some searches can take a while and cause Outlook to seem unresponsive; this is normal and Outlook should respond again once the query finishes or times out.\n    The search results will be displayed.  Select the person you want, and click on either the To, Cc, or Bcc buttons.\n    Click OK.  The person will be added to your message on the line you specified.\n\n  \nMac Mail\nSetup \n \n\n    Go to the Mail menu and select Preferences \n    Click on the Composing icon\n    Check the box for \"Automatically complete addresses\"\n    Click on Configure LDAP\n    Click on the plus (+) button\n    Name: UH LDAP\n    Server: ldap1.its.hawaii.edu\n    Search Base: ou=people,dc=hawaii,dc=edu\n    Leave everything else as the default\n    Click Save \n    Click Done \n    Close the Preferences window by clicking on the red dot in the upper right corner of the window.\n\n\nUsage\n \n\n    Create a new message\n    You can type part of the person's name or a combination of first and last, where you would type the email address.\n    Mac Mail will display a list of choices.  Click on the correct choice and it will be inserted where your cursor is."

You will need to supply a name for the new list (must include a hyphen), provide a description, and select one of the configuration options.\n    At the bottom of the page, acknowledge the terms of use (UH Executive Policy E2.210, Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statutes, List Owner's Responsibilities) by checking off the boxes and click on \"Request List\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tI don't remember my password for LISTSERV.

You should see a message indicating that \"Your new password was registered successfully\".  Note: If you do not confirm within 48 hours, your request to register a new password will be cancelled and you must start a new request. \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tI currently own a LISTSERV list. How do I change the owner?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    From the home page, click on \"Log In\" in the top-right corner and sign in using your email address and LISTSERV password.\n    Under \"List Management\" on the left, select \"List Configuration\". Then, select the \"Administrators\" tab.\n    \n    \n     \n    On the List Configuration page, select the list that you are modifying from the drop-down menu below \"Select List\".\n    Note: If you only own one list, it will be selected by default.\n    \n    \n     \n    Enter the email address(es) of the new owner(s) with one address per line, review the address(es) entered for typos, and click on \"Update\" when done. Any owner listed under \"Quiet:\" will have list management rights, but will not receive any delivery error or administrative mail from LISTSERV.\n    Note: 1) If you are removing yourself as an owner, once you click on submit you will immediately lose access to manage the list. Be sure this is what you want to do! 2) Only a LISTSERV site administrator can add other lists as owners of a list.\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCan a LISTSERV list have more than one owner?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYes, LISTSERV lists can have multiple owners. You can view or modify owners by following the steps listed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tI don't know who owns a particular LISTSERV list. How do I contact the owner?\n\n\n\tTo contact the owner(s) of a LISTSERV list, send an email to listname-request@lists.hawaii.edu, where listname is name of the list in question. For example if you want to contact the owner(s) of the list LISTSERV-L@lists.hawaii.edu, you would email LISTSERV-L-request@lists.hawaii.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhy is our LISTSERV list not publicly listed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTo display your list on the main page, you will need to change the \"Confidential\" setting.\n\n    From the home page, click on \"Log In\" in the top-right corner and sign in using your email address and LISTSERV password.\n    Under \"List Management\" on the left, select \"List Configuration\" followed by \"Show All Keywords\".\n    \n    \n     \n    On the List Configuration page, first select the list that you are modifying. Then, scroll down and click on \"Confidential\".  Note: If you only own one list, it will be selected by default.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Using the drop-down menu, select \"Service\" and click on \"Update\". (Selecting \"No\" will also cause the list to be displayed on the L-Soft Global Lists) Note: Use of the confidential setting does not safeguard your list other than removing/displaying your list on the index of lists.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    To check if your list is visible, click on \"Subscriptions\" in the “Subscriber Options” menu. Then, click “Customize Report”, select “Show All Lists” from the drop-down menu, and click “Update”.\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWe have a new list, but when I try to send an email to it I get a \"5.1.1 illegal or unknown alias\"\n\n\n\n\n\tIf you are correctly addressing the list (don't forget that all list names have a hyphen in them), then there may have been an error in the list creation process. In this case, please contact the ITS Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 (neighbor island residents may call (800) 558-2669), email help@hawaii.edu, or use the form at http://www.hawaii.edu/its/contact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow do I add or remove subscribers to a LISTSERV list?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    From the home page, click on \"Log In\" in the top-right corner and sign in using your email address and LISTSERV password.\n    Under the \"List Management\" options in the menu on the left, select \"Subscriber Management\". You may need to click on the '>' button in the top-left corner to unhide the menu.\n    \n    \n     \n    Use the \"Select List\" drop-down menu to choose which list you would like to manage subscribers for.\n    \n    \n     \n    To add a subscriber, enter their email address optionally followed by their first and last name in the text field next to \"Email Address and Name\". You may also select whether or not the subscriber receives an email notification. When done, click on \"Add Subscriber\". \n    \n    To delete a subscriber, enter their email address in the field below \"Search for Subscribers (list name)\". Then, click on \"Search\". At the bottom of the subsequent page, click on \"Delete\".\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow do I add or remove many subscribers to a LISTSERV list at one time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYou will need a plain text formatted file with one email address (optionally followed by a first and last name separated by a space) per line. Each line or entry must be separated by a carriage return. You can use programs such as \"Notepad\" or \"Microsoft Word\" but you must save the file in plain text (*.txt) format.\n\n\n\n\n\n    From the home page, click on \"Log In\" in the top-right corner and sign in using your email address and LISTSERV password.\n    Under the \"List Management\" options in the menu on the left, select \"Subscriber Reports\". You may need to click on the '>' button in the top-left corner to unhide the menu.\n    \n    \n     \n    Click on the \"Bulk Operations\" link next to the \"Add Subscriber\" section of the page.\n    \n    \n     \n    In the window that appears, select your desired option and click on \"Choose File\" to select the plain text file containing the email addresses you would like added or removed. Then, click \"Import\".\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow do I delete a LISTSERV list?\n\n\n\n\n\tIf you are a list owner, please email help@hawaii.edu from your @hawaii.edu account with the name of the list that you would like deleted. The request may take 1-2 business days to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhy don't I receive a copy of my own message when sending to a LISTSERV list?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGmail recognizes that the incoming message is identical to the copy in your Sent Items and does not duplicate it to your inbox.\nGoogle's recommendation is that you cc yourself when sending messages to a mailing list from your Google@UH Gmail account. Since you are unable to receive copies of your own messages, another available option is to enable the ACK setting, which is an acknowledgement email from LISTSERV that your message was sent to X number of recipients. In addition, if your list has archives enabled, you can see if your message was posted to the list by checking the archives..\nTo change your current ACK settings, you may do the following:\nA. Enable ACK in your subscription options\n\n    Under Subscriber Options in the navigation pane on the left, select Subscriptions.\n    Click on the name of the list you want to enable acknowledgements for.\n    Click on the menu button along the right-side of the page (it should look like three horizontal lines stacked together). Then, click on Subscribe or Unsubscribe.\n    In the Acknowledgements section, select Short Message Confirming Receipt. Then, click on Update Settings.\n\nB. Enable ACK as default for new subscribers (List Owners Only)\n\n    Under the List Management options in the navigation pane on the left, select List Configuration.\n    Click on the Subscriptions tab.\n    Select the list that you are modifying from the drop-down menu. Then, scroll down to Default-Options.\n    Add the keyword ACK to the text field. If there are already other keywords listed as Default-Options, simply add a comma followed by the keyword ACK to the end. Then, click on Update.\n\nC. Enable ACK for existing subscribers (List Owners Only)\n\n    Under the List Management options in the navigation pane on the left, select Subscriber Reports.\n    Select the list that you are modifying from the drop-down menu.\n    Click on Customize Report and check Acknowledgements. Then, click on Update.\n    Use the check boxes on the left to select specific subscribers (or click on Check All to select all subscribers) and, using the drop-down menu at the bottom of the Acknowledgements column, select Ack. Then, click Update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow Do I Enable UTF-8 Compatible Headers in LISTSERV?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nTo designate UTF-8 as the character set for your list header, you may use the following instructions:\n\n\n    Log into LISTSERV.\n    Enable Expert Mode.\n    \n        Click on your email address in the top-right corner followed by Edit Profile.\n        Select Expert Mode using the Mode drop-down menu and click on Save.\n    \n    \n    Under List Management in the navigation pane on the left, select List Configuration.\n    Click on Show All Keywords next to the Keyword search box.\n    \n         \n    \n    \n    Scroll down through the resulting list of keywords and click on Misc-Options.\n    \n    \n     \n    Enter UTF8_HEADER in the Misc-Options= field. Then, click Update.\n    \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\tHow Do I Set a Footer(Bottom Banner) in LISTSERV?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBottom banner templates allow you to include a footer on each message sent to a list. The DEFAULT_BOTTOM_BANNER and DEFAULT_BOTTOM_BANNER_HTML templates provided include a link that subscribers can click on to easily unsubscribe from a list. An example is provided below.\n\n\n\nTo enable the banner, you will need to copy the contents of the DEFAULT_BOTTOM_BANNER and DEFAULT_BOTTOM_BANNER_HTML templates to the BOTTOM_BANNER and BOTTOM_BANNER_HTML templates respectively.\n\n    Log into LISTSERV.\n    Under the List Management options in the menu on the left, select Mail Templates. You may need to click on the > button in the top-left corner to unhide the menu.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    If you own more than one list, use the Select List drop-down menu to choose which list you would like to modify mail templates for. Then, using the Template Categories drop-down menu, choose Top and Bottom Banners and click Select.\n    \n    \n     \n    In the resulting list of available templates, click on DEFAULT_BOTTOM_BANNER.\n    \n    \n     \n    Copy all of the text in the Content field.\n    Click on Back. Then, navigate to the BOTTOM_BANNER template.\n    Paste the text copied in Step 5 into the Content field of the BOTTOM_BANNER template and click on Update.\n    Repeat Steps 4 through 7 with DEFAULT_BOTTOM_BANNER_HTML instead of DEFAULT_BOTTOM_BANNER and BOTTOM_BANNER_HTML instead of BOTTOM_BANNER to edit the HTML versions of the templates.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\tHow Do I Set a Mail Template in LISTSERV?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYou can create or modify templates to customize informational messages from the LISTSERV processor. Mail templates do not modify the contents or style of mail sent to a list or through the newsletter feature.\nNote: The following sections make use of a specialized template syntax. For more information on how to use template commands and variables, click on the ? in the top-right corner or visit the official LISTSERV documentation.\nSetting a Pre-defined Template Style\n\n    From the LISTSERV home page, click on Log In in the top-right corner and sign in using your email address and password.\n    Under the List Management options in the menu on the left, select Mail Templates. You may need to click on the > button in the top-left corner to unhide the menu.\n    If you own more than one list, use the Select List drop-down menu to choose which list you would like to set a template style for.\n    Use the Template Style drop-down menu to select the desired style.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    To apply your chosen style use the Select button. Alternatively, you can use the Preview button to see how the style looks.\n    You can test if the change was applied successfully by adding/removing a subscriber or performing any other command that generates an informational message from LISTSERV.\n\nModifying an Existing Mail Template\n\n    From the LISTSERV home page, click on Log In in the top-right corner and sign in using your email address and password.\n    Under the List Management options in the menu on the left, select Mail Templates. You may need to click on the > button in the top-left corner to unhide the menu.\n    If you own more than one list, use the Select List drop-down menu to choose which list you would like to modify templates for.\n    If the template you would like to modify is not already listed in the table below, use the Template Categories drop-down menu to select the appropriate type.\n    Click on the name of the template you want to modify in the table at the bottom of the page.\n    Make the desired changes in the Content text field. Then, click Update.\n    \n    \n\nCreating a New Mail Template\n\n    From the LISTSERV home page, click on Log In in the top-right corner and sign in using your email address and password.\n    Under the List Management options in the menu on the left, select Mail Templates. You may need to click on the > button in the top-left corner to unhide the menu.\n    If you own more than one list, use the Select List drop-down menu to choose which list you would like to create a new template for.\n    Click on Create New Template.\n    Enter a name and description for the new template in the Template Name and Template Description fields respectively. Then, click Create.\n    Enter the desired text and template commands into the Content text field. Then, click Update.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\tHow do I stop receiving messages from a LISTSERV list temporarily without being removed from it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSend an email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank subject line and the message body containing the SET command, the list name, and the NOMAIL option.\nSET listname NOMAIL\nYou should receive a confirmation that your subscription settings were updated. To resume receiving mail for the list, send another email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank subject line and the message body containing the following:\nSET listname MAIL\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\tWhy doesn't my LISTSERV list deliver mail anymore? Or LISTSERV reports that the list is held?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThis can happen if the list has exceeded its daily message threshold. By default, this value is set to 50. Once the daily threshold is met, the list will stop delivering emails until a free command is issued.\nFreeing The List\nA list owner will need to compose an email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank subject line and the following text in the message body:\n\nfree listname\nNote: Do not include \"@lists.hawaii.edu\" at the end of the listname\nAlternately, the list owner can log into https://listserv.hawaii.edu, click on LISTSERV Command, select the relevant list from the drop-down menu, input the above command (i.e. free listname), and click on Submit.\nIncreasing the Daily-Threshold\nIn the event that this limit is frequently reached, the list owner may also consider increasing the Daily-Threshold value to prevent the list from being held again.\n\n    Log in to https://listserv.hawaii.edu.\n    Under the List Management options in the navigation pane on the left, select List Configuration.\n    Click on the Subscriptions tab.\n    Scroll down to Daily-Threshold and enter the desired value into the corresponding field.\n    Click on Update."

Using a COMPLETELY NEW, unique password not used on any other account or website will decrease the likelihood of another compromise.

However, before you can actually connect to any web pages or your email, you will need to do the following:\n(Do this section each time you want to connect to the UHM wireless network)\n\n    On the Home screen, touch Safari.  Go to any web address.  If you are already at a web page, refresh it.\n    \n    You will be asked to login.  In the UH Username box, type your UH Username.  The UH Username is the part before the @ of your hawaii.edu email address.  For example, if your hawaii.edu address is jdoe@hawaii.edu, your username is jdoe.\n    \n    In the UH Password box, type your password\n    \n    Touch Login or Go.\n\nYou should now be connected to the UHM wireless network.  You can tell you have successfully joined the UHM wireless network by checking in the upper left corner of the screen.  You should see the wireless symbol (baseball-diamond shape).  The amount of lines shown in the wireless symbol represents the wireless signal's strength.\nIf you wish, you can add your iPhone/iPad to the wireless passthrough.  This  will allow your iPhone/iPad to connect to the UHM network without having to  login each time.  For more information, please refer to the section,  \"Wireless Authentication Passthrough\" in this article: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1037.\nConfiguring Mail\n\nThe iPhone/iPad comes with a built-in Mail client that you can use to view your UH email.  This is the preferred method of viewing your mail on the iPhone/iPad, as the UH Web Mail does not fully work with the iPhone/iPad's Safari browser.\nFollow these steps to configure the iPhone/iPad to receive UH email, with the option of also syncing your UH contacts and calendar.\n\n    On the Home screen, touch Settings, then touch Passwords & Accounts [iOS 10: Settings->Mail->Accounts; older than iOS 10: Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendar]\n    \n    Touch Add Account\n    \n    Touch Google\n    \n    In the \"Email or Phone\" box, enter your username@hawaii.edu address.  For example, if your UH email address is joe@hawaii.edu, enter joe@hawaii.edu.\n    \n    Touch Next\n    \n    At the next screen, login with your normal UH Username and password.\n    \n    At the next screen, select the items (Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Notes)  that you wish to sync with your phone.  An item is selected if it is \"green\".  Tap the slider button for each item to toggle it as selected or not.\n    \n    Touch Save (in the upper right corner of the screen)\n    \n    The account will be added with the description \"Gmail\".  To change this, touch on the account you just added.\n    \n    Touch on Account\n    \n    Change the \"Description\" line to something more descriptive, such as UH email.\n    \n    Touch Done (in the upper right corner of the screen).\n    \n    Touch Accounts, then Settings (upper left corner of the screen) to exit back to the Settings screen.\n    \n\nIf for some reason the above steps do not work, you can follow these steps to configure the iPhone/iPad to receive UH email as an IMAP client.  Note this applies to hawaii.edu email only; if you have an email account with another provider such as RoadRunner, or another department such as soest.hawaii.edu, the configuration would be different. \nNote: Make sure you have enabled IMAP in Google@UH Gmail before you continue; instructions can be found here.\n\n    On the Home screen, touch Settings, then touch Passwords & Accounts [iOS 10: Settings->Mail->Accounts; older than iOS 10: Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendar]\n    \n    Touch Add Account\n    \n    Touch Other\n    \n    Touch Add Mail Account\n    \n    In the Name box, type your name as you want it to appear on outgoing mail messages\n    \n    In the Address box, type your hawaii.edu email address\n    \n    In the Password box, type your password\n    \n    In the Description box, type a simple description for your account, e.g. UH Mail\n    \n    Touch Next (in the upper right corner of the screen)\n    \n    On the next screen, make sure IMAP is selected\n    \n    Under the \"Incoming Mail Server\" section:\n    \n        In the Host Name box, type imap.gmail.com\n        In the User Name box, type your <username@hawaii.edu>\n        In the Password box, your password should already be filled in\n    \n    \n    \n    Scroll down.

Power management, standard in Windows and Mac operating systems, can put inactive monitors and computer systems (CPU, hard drive, etc.) into low-power \"sleep\" mode. Moving the mouse or touching the keyboard \"wakes\" up the monitor and computer in seconds. Power saving settings can be adjusted to meet your needs.\nA desktop computer when shut down uses 3-5 watts; when it is idle, it uses an average of 89 watts. A laptop computer when shut down uses 3 watts; when it is idle, it uses 15-25 watts.* By putting your computer to sleep when it's inactive, considerable energy savings can be realized.\n*from Dell on Dell: Energy Efficiency\n\nRecommendations for PC Energy Savings\n\n     Turn off computers when you are done for the day.*\n\n\n*Exceptions: if software updates and backups are done after work hours, consult with your departmental IT staff. Leave your computer on if you need to access it remotely.\n\n    Set power management options to automatically put your computer to sleep/standby mode after 15 minutes or less of inactivity.*\n\n\n* If nothing else, set power management for monitors. Set hard drive power management after consulting with your departmental IT staff as applications may be affected.\n\n\n   Recommendations for Power Management \n   (adapted from MIT for use at UH, http://web.mit.edu/ist/initiatives/it-energy/guidelines.html)\n   Configuring Power Management for Personal Computers http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/926\n\n   WINDOWS XP (Start > Control Panel > Power Options)\n\n   Desktop Computers:\n   Monitor - turn off after 10 minutes of inactivity\n   Hard disk - turn off after 5 minutes of inactivity\n   System standby - after 1 hour of inactivity\n   System hibernation - never\n\n   Laptop Computers (plugged in):\n   Turn off monitor - after 10 mins\n   Turn off hard disks - after 20 mins\n   System standby - after 1 hour\n   System hibernates - never\n\n   Laptop Computers (on battery):\n   Turn off monitor - after 5 mins\n   Turn off hard disks - after 10 mins\n   System standby - after 1 hour\n   System hibernates - after 2 hours\n\n   WINDOWS VISTA (Start > Control Panel > System and Maintenance > Power Options)\n\n   Desktop Computers:\n   Monitor - turn off after 10 minutes of inactivity\n   Hard disk - turn off after 5 minutes of inactivity\n   System standby - after 1 hour of inactivity\n   System hibernation - never\n\n   Laptop Computers (on battery):\n   Display - turn off after 5 minutes of inactivity\n   Put computer to sleep - after 15 minutes of inactivity\n   Hard disk - turn off after 5 minutes of inactivity\n   \n   Laptop Computers (plugged in):\n   Display - turn off after 10 minutes of inactivity\n   Put computer to sleep - after 1 hour of inactivity\n   Hard disk - turn off after 20 minutes of inactivity\n   \n   MAC OS (System Preferences > Energy Saver)\n\n   Desktop Computers:\n   Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: 1 hour\n   Put the display to sleep when it is inactive for: 15 minutes\n   Do not check the box for \"Put the hard disk to sleep when possible\"\n\n   Laptop Computers (on power adapter):\n   Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: 1 hour\n   Put the display to sleep when the computer is inactive for: 15 minutes\n   Do not check the box for \"Put the hard disk to sleep when possible\"   \n\n   Laptop Computers (on battery):\n   Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: 15 minutes\n   Put the display to sleep when the computer is inactive for: 5 minutes\n   Check the box for \"Put the hard disk to sleep when possible\"\n\n    Avoid using screen savers. \n\nThey waste energy and do not save the screen. A screen saver requires that the PC and monitor be at full power. Some graphics-intensive screen savers may burn twice as much energy. Screen savers may prevent the computer from entering sleep mode. You only save energy if the monitor goes dark by going to sleep. Modern CRT and LCD screens are not prone to \"burn in\" from phosphor burn as older monitors.\n\n    For desktop computers, use LCDs instead of CRT monitors.\n\nLCDs use less energy (30-35 watts) than CRT monitors (80 watts).\n\n    Use a laptop computer, if possible. They are more energy-efficient than desktop computers.\n\nA desktop computer when idle uses an average of 89 watts. A laptop when idle uses 15-25 watts. (Dell on Dell: Energy Efficiency)\nPlease consider your work requirements and budget when purchasing computers. Laptops cost more, have less expansion/upgrade options, and are more prone to theft/security issues than desktop computers.\n\n    Purchase Energy Star-rated computers when possible. \n\nEnergy Star is a joint program of the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy to help us save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices. From July 20, 2007, Energy Star's new specifications for computers went into effect. Only the most energy-efficient computers will qualify for the Energy Star label.\n\n   http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductGroup&pgw_code=CO\n\nFAQ\n(adapted from http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_faq)\n \n1. Why should I use power management features?\nYou can save up to $75 or more per computer by activating system standby or sleep mode features. You save energy, reduce carbon dioxide emissions and help prevent global warming.\n2. My screen saver is activated. Do I need to activate power management features?\nIf you want to use your screen saver in conjunction with monitor power management, set the screen saver \"wait time\" to less than the period of time after which the monitor enters sleep mode. If your screen saver appears but your monitor never enters sleep mode, your screen saver may be the culprit: try disabling it.\n3. Do computers and monitors use more energy with power management features activated due to power surges when cycling on and off?\nIn reality, the small surge of power created when some devices are turned on is vastly smaller than the energy used by running the device when it is not needed.\n4. Can sleep features wear out hardware by forcing the computer to turn on and off several times a day?\n\"Modern computers are designed to handle 40,000 on-off cycles before failure, and you're not likely to approach that number during the average computer's five- to seven-year life span. In fact, IBM and Hewlett Packard encourage their own employees to turn off idle computers, and some studies indicate it would require on-off cycling every five minutes to harm a hard drive.\"\n \n\nTechnical Considerations\n\n    Your computer will not go to sleep mode if programs are running in the background.\n    \n    If your computer is too old (> 5 years old), it may not have power management capabilities.\n    \n    If you run special applications which require the computer not to be in sleep mode, please do NOT turn on power management for the hard drive.\n    \n    See case studies of businesses, universities and schools that have activated system standby.\n    http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_ss#uwi\n\n \n\nSoftware\nEdison for Windows, free for individuals to manage their own PC, free from Verdiem for Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7\nEdison for Windows\n\nEZ Wizard tool for individuals to manage their own PC, free from EPA,  for Windows 2000 and XP\nhttp://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_ez_wiz\n\nEZ GPO network management tool for system/network administrators to centrally manage computers, free from EPA\nhttp://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_ez_gpo\n\nResources\nEnergy Star\nhttp://www.energystar.gov/\nMIT\nhttp://web.mit.edu/ist/initiatives/it-energy/guidelines.html\nOhio State University\nhttp://www.ohio.edu/sustainability/greenpc/\nMicrosoft\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/winpowmgmt.mspx\nSaving Electricity\nhttp://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/computers.html\nClimate Savers\nhttp://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/learn/energy-saver-guide/\nSave and Go Green: Computer Energy Saving\nhttp://www.paystolivegreen.com/2008/08/save-and-go-green-computer-energy-saving/\n10 Computer Energy Saving Tips: Go Green\nhttp://computers.toptenreviews.com/economy/10-computer-energy-saving-tips-go-green.htm"

(Securing Your Computer)\n    Backup your laptop frequently.\n    Physically secure the laptop with physical locking devices, especially if access to the laptop is relatively open.\n    Do not leave the laptop unattended, even if only for a few minutes. \n    Do not leave laptops in cars including car trunks.\n    When traveling, do not leave the laptop in plain sight when not in your room.  Secure the laptop in an in-room safe if available.\n    Ensure that the laptop has strong passwords for all usernames.\n    Configure your laptop to prompt for a password when it's powered on or waking from sleep/hibernation.\n    If at all possible, DO NOT store sensitive information on the laptop.\n    If absolutely necessary to keep sensitive information on the laptop, ensure that the information is encrypted. (PC encryption, Mac encryption)\n    If using a public wireless network (hotel, internet cafe, airport wireless network) to access sensitive information, ensure that your traffic is encrypted.  Make sure that the website you are using is a secured website (look for the lock on your browser) or use the UH VPN.\n\n \nAdditional tips on safeguarding your laptop can be found at: \n\n    FTC - Laptop Security\n    http://labmice.techtarget.com/articles/laptopsecurity.htm\n    \n    Keep Your Computer Secure At Home"

    "title": "The UH Identity Management System",
    "content": "The University of Hawai'i Identity Management System (UHIMS) collects and consolidates information concerning people associated with the University so that UH may better establish and manage a single, permanent identity for each person. This unique identity enables a person to access all of the appropriate online resources centrally hosted by the University.\nMiddleware is considered to be software glue that enables disparate administrative applications, such as Banner and PeopleSoft, to work together. UHIMS is middleware. It provides UH the ability to automatically enable and disable access to online resources, such as email, Laulima, eCafe, lab computers, and administrative and student online resources, such as MyUH.\nOne of the early accomplishments of UHIMS was to establish the UH Number as a replacement for the Social Security Number (SSN) in order to better protect our community members from identity theft; it is no longer appropriate to use the SSN as a unique identifier. The UH Number has been called \"employee ID number\" and \"student ID number\". Whether a person is a student, faculty, staff, affiliate, ohana, retiree, or some combination of these, a person's UH Number remains the same. Closely associated with the UH Number is a UH Username. The UH Username is used to establish your email address, and, along with a unique password of your choice, it will be your key to using the University's online resources.\nAs a member of the UH community, one sometimes traverses many roles (student, faculty, staff, affiliate, retiree, ohana) and, at times, is in multiple roles at once. UHIMS tracks a person's roles to help ensure that each person has access to the appropriate online resources and services. Additionally, UHIMS provides each person with email updates of role changes that might impact one's access to services, listing in the UH Online Directory, etc.\nUHIMS implements the following policies as of 2023:\n\n    Students, Faculty, Staff, Retirees and Emeriti, by default, have access to basic online services (see Resources below for links to more information).\n    Retirees and Emeriti retain basic online services by subscription; they will receive annual email messages reminding them to confirm renewal for another year.\n    Students and pre-students who do not register for classes, and Faculty and Staff that leave employment at UH (retiring is not quite the same thing) automatically transition to a UHIMS role of 'Ohana and, by default, are granted a 180-day grace period during which continued access to email and other basic online services is provided. During the grace period, the option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services is provided. See Resources below for more information on Online Services for 'Ohana.\n    The option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services is available to users prior to losing their active affiliation and during their grace period. Enrollment is retained by annual renewal; reminders to renew will be sent by email.\n    The grace period is provided so that data, files, etc. can be archived by the owner and relocated (see Resources below for a link to instructions on saving mail and webpage data to your computer). At the end of the grace period for ohana, all files are deleted from UH servers, which includes personal webpages. Enrollment in our 'Ohana online services will preserve access to the UH email account and all mail data stored there.\n    For 'Ohana that do not renew their annual enrollment in our 'Ohana online services, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.) is removed and access to log in with their UH Username and password is revoked.\n    Beginning on 1/29/2024, 'Ohana users are provided with 7.5 GB of storage quota for their Google@UH account. Users will have the entire length of their grace period (180 days) in order to review their storage usage and download/export/delete emails, files, and photos to bring their usage under their 7.5 GB quota. 'Ohana users who exceed their quota may have their UH Usernames disabled. This will result in the loss of access to associated services and the loss of all data stored within their Google@UH account (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.). See Resources below for more information on 'Ohana Google@UH storage limitations and quotas.\n    For retirees that do not renew their annual subscription for UH basic online services, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.) is removed, including personal webpages.\n    For emeriti that do not renew their annual subscription upon expiration, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.) is removed, including personal webpages. Exclusive to Emeriti, there is an option to request that personal webpages continue to be preserved for as long as possible for the benefit of the larger academic community.

Phishing emails are usually spammed (sent via bulk, unsolicited email) or could be targeted to a specific organization or group. After obtaining usernames and passwords, cyber criminals could impersonate the owner of the compromised account, steal confidential information, commit identity theft, send more spam, and commit other criminal activities.\nIf you receive phishing email (which may look authentic and legitimate) requesting sensitive information (e.g. usernames, passwords, email addresses, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, date of birth, etc.):\n\n    DO NOT REPLY to the email. Replying (even to tell the spammer to stop) tells the spammer that your email address is valid.\n    DO NOT PROVIDE any sensitive information, especially if the email is unsolicited or from an unknown user.\n    DO NOT CLICK on any links/images/attachments contained in the phishing email. Do NOT enter personal sensitive information into online forms. Malware may also be downloaded and installed on your computer.\n    IF IN DOUBT, CHECK IT OUT!\n    \n        CALL the sender/agency/organization to verify that the email is legitimate.\n        Contact the ITS Help Desk if you have questions about the validity of an official-looking communication.\n    \n    \n\nAfter a targeted phishing email is reported, Information Technology Services (ITS) may choose to implement protective measures such as:\n\n    investigating new phishing attempts\n    blocking the email address from sending to UH\n    blocking the reply email address from receiving from UH\n    contacting users who replied to the phishing email before it was reported and blocked\n    blocking access to suspicious websites that are linked within the phishing email\n    posting new phishing email on the Security Alerts website at http://www.hawaii.edu/its\n\nPhishing notification\nPlease go to http://www.hawaii.edu/its under the Security Alerts section to check for the latest phishing attacks targeting UH usernames.\nIf you would like to receive phishing notices by email, go to http://www.hawaii.edu/its/notices/index.php and subscribe to our phishing-alert email list.\nGeneral guidelines for reporting spam/phishing\n\n    Google@UH users --> you can report spam or phishing emails directly to Google\n    \n        To report phishing attempts to Google, follow the instructions at: \n        http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=184963\n        To report spam to Google, follow the instructions at: \n        http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=190737\n    \n    \n    Targeting UH usernames --> send to phishing@hawaii.edu with full mail headers\n    \n          See http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/895 for displaying full mail headers.\n          See http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/898 for reporting a new/suspicious email targeting UH usernames.\n    \n    \n    Spam sent from a hawaii.edu address --> send to uhabuse@hawaii.edu with full mail headers\n    General spam --> delete; do not need to report; can block sender's email or entire domain from your account using filters. http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=8151\n\nMore information\nProtect Yourself Against Phishing\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/phishing/\nSpam and Phishing\nhttps://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/online-safety-basics/spam-and-phishing/\nSpam at the University of Hawaii\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/askus/571\nSecurity (or lack of it) on the Internet (Spam and Phishing)\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/askus/687"

Upon leaving your position and/or when you are no longer responsible for coordinating and responding to public safety and emergency preparedness events, the WPS and GETS services must be cancelled. \nFor more information, call the ITS - Telecom Office at (808) 956-6033.\nRelated links:\nGovernment Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS)"
